description: "Katherine Houston Artichoke This is a artichoke figurine made by Katherine Houston. Katherine Houston is a living artist working in an 18th century technique, adapting the techniques and masterful creations of the past with a 21st century approach to design and technicality. She is one of the few artists in the world carrying on a tradition of hand sculpting hard paste porcelain, decorated with a broad range of color over glazes. The vegetable is miniature in size. It was hand painted. The layers of leaves are green with purple-ish pink tips. Size: 2 1/4&quot; x 2 5/8&quot; The bottom reads, &quot;KHO &#39;00 PdP USA.&quot; The artichoke is in excellent condition. It has a couple tiny spots where the glaze skipped. Please, take a look at the photos provided. Take a look at all shipping options. Thank you for your interest!",

title: "Artichoke Jewelry Artichoke Necklace Golden Artichoke",
description: "This artichoke necklace is an handmade piece completely made in sterling silver. The artichoke was made using the lost wax casting process. I sculpt manually the entire piece in wax and then the wax prototype was injected in silver in a professional foundry. The extremities of the artichoke leaves are gold plated and the pendant hangs in a sterling silver chain with a total length of 80 cm (when the lock is is open). The lock is not in sterling silver, and does not allow the chain to be reopened. The dimensions of the artichoke pendant are approximately 3,4 cm x 1,2 cm x 1,2 cm. If you would like to have this necklace with another chain length, please contact me. The piece will arrive in a box with the logo of the store.

description: "This listing is for ONE decorative pillow cover in a soft artichoke green and white print. This is a soft artichoke green that is very hard to photograph, but gorgeous in person! The throw pillow cover can be made to fit any size pillow insert and is 100% cotton. Simply select the size and fabric you would like at checkout. To add multiple pillow covers to your cart, you can increase the quantity, or add the pillow covers to your cart one at a time. *****This listing is for one pillow cover, the inserts are not included.***** 1. Chevron 2. Alex 3. Small Quatrefoil 4. Lyon 5. Winston 6. Sheffield The fabric is the same on both the front and back of the pillow covers. The exact placement of the pattern may vary with each pillow. The covers have an envelope style enclosure for easy access. All inside edges are treated to prevent fraying, and stress points are triple stitched. Care of the pillow covers is simple, just machine wash in cold water, and lay flat to dry. Be sure not to machine dry. To ensure a good fit, the pillow cover will measure about 1/2&quot; smaller than the pillow insert. If you want a snugger or looser fit, let me know in your message to seller at checkout. *****This listing is for just the pillow covers, the inserts are not included.***** You can find these pillow inserts at craft stores like Hobby Lobby and Joanns, or department stores like Wal-Mart and Target. To purchase a single pillow cover, lumbar pillow cover, or to mix and match any of my fabrics, just use these listings in the size you need and let me know which fabric you&#39;d like in the note to seller at checkout: https://www.etsy.com/shop/CastawayCoveDecor?section_id=14221723&ref=shopsection_leftnav_2 Purchase a zipper cover add on here: https://www.etsy.com/listing/206080465/invisible-zipper-add-on-pillow-covers If you need a different size, or a different color, please contact me with your request.

announcement: "I will be out of town until Thursday March 10th. All orders will ship out on time when I return. I will have limited access to the internet at this time but I&#39;ll do my best to respond to emails during this time. Decorative pillow covers in bright and sophisticated patterns! My covers are perfect for a quick spruce up of your living space, office area, or any event. Please note that my listings do not include the actual pillow insert, just the pillow cover. To find your perfect pillow, use the search bar in my shop under this announcement or use the shop sections to the left to search by color. I also have many of my pillow covers listed in the handy Mix and Match section to the left of this announcement. Or, use the Single Pillow Cover section to customize your order. I accept Visa and Mastercard in addition to Paypal. Current production time before shipping is 4-7 business days. Please contact me if you need your order sent out on a rush basis or priority shipping. International orders can take from 2-8 weeks to arrive, so be sure to order early if you&#39;re planning an event! I do refund any gross excess shipping charges. Please feel free to contact me if you don&#39;t see a fabric or size you want! I can also mix and match any combination of fabrics and sizes. I love custom orders and I&#39;m happy to make the perfect pillow cover for your space. Before placing an order please measure your pillow inserts to be sure that you&#39;re ordering the correct size. Use a flexible measuring tape and measure from side seam to side seam across the middle, both the width and length of the pillow without squishing it down at all. I design all my pillow covers to fit standard size commercial inserts. They will measure about 1/2 inch smaller than the intended pillow insert. For example, all pillow covers marked 18&quot; X 18&quot; are designed for 18&quot; X 18&quot; pillow inserts and will have a finished measurement of approximately 17.5&quot; X 17.5&quot; to encase the insert properly without being baggy. This slightly smaller size ensures a nice professional fit without looking too tight or too baggy. If you have a different size pillow and want a custom made cover let me know and I&#39;ll be happy to help! Please read my shop policies before ordering as it contains important return/exchange information. I appreciate you looking at my shop and hope you find just the perfect pillow for you!",

sale_message: "Heather Yellen CastAwayCoveDecor THANK YOU I am grateful for your purchase! All orders ship within 4-7 BUSINESS days of your payment clearing. Each item is handmade to order and may take the 4-7 business days to create. If you need to contact me, the best way is to send me an email here on Etsy. Please verify that your shipping address is correct. If you find you&#39;ve used the incorrect address, please notify me as soon as possible so I will ship it to the correct address. My typical refund requests are not due to design or color issues, but to sizing issues. The best way to measure your insert is straight across the center of the insert, from side seam to side seam across the middle, using a piece of string or flexible tape. Do not measure from corner to corner! If you have any sizing or measurement questions, please feel free to convo me! If there is an issue with your items after you receive them, my goal is to resolve it quickly. Please send me a convo here on Etsy before you leave a review so I can fix the issue. I like my customers to be happy and leave positive Etsy Reviews! I&#39;m happy you own a CastawayCoveDecor creation, I hope you enjoy your creation as much as I enjoyed making it!

policy_welcome: "Welcome to CastAwayCoveDecor, my little crafting haven by the sea. I hope you like what you see. If you like a particular piece, but in another color, please contact me. I love being able to create that special order just for you. Please note that the colors in the pictures will vary from monitor to monitor. I try to give specific details regarding fabric used in my descriptions. *****Important note about pillow sizes***** Before placing an order please measure your pillow inserts to be sure that you&#39;re ordering the correct size. Use a flexible measuring tape and measure from side seam to side seam, both the width and length of the pillow without squishing it down at all. Sometimes the tag will say it&#39;s a 20&quot;x20&quot; pillow, but it will really measure smaller than that! I design all my pillow covers to fit standard size commercial inserts. They will measure about 1/2 inch smaller than the intended pillow insert. For example, all pillow covers marked 18&quot; X 18&quot; are designed for 18&quot; X 18&quot; pillow inserts and will have a finished measurement of approximately 17.5&quot; X 17.5&quot; to encase the insert properly without being baggy. This slightly smaller size ensures a nice professional fit without looking too tight or too baggy. If you have a different size pillow and want a custom made cover let me know and I&#39;ll be happy to help!",
policy_payment: "I accept credit card payments and gift cards directly through Etsy! I also accept payment through PayPal. You will be given a payment option at checkout and may choose whichever you prefer. ",
policy_shipping: "Please ensure your shipping address is correct when the order is placed. I am not responsible for lost packages as a result of incorrect shipping addresses. All items are wrapped with care and sent in a strong shipping envelope or box. I strive to send all custom orders out within 4-7 business days of purchase. If the item is already created, it will be shipped within 24 hours of purchase. US deliveries are sent by First Class Mail and should be to you within 4-10 days, excepting busy times of the year. Curtain panels are made and shipped within 1-2 weeks, or earlier if the fabric is in stock. All curtain panels ship by priority mail. Please contact me prior to payment, if you wish me to ship at a different rate. I would be happy to gift wrap at no extra charge, please let me know in the message to seller and I will be happy to select tasteful wrapping for the recipient. I do ship internationally, and I do refund gross excess shipping charges. Unfortunately, I am not responsible for any duties/taxes/customs fees charged by other countries at customs. This tax is the responsibility of the buyer solely. ",
policy_refunds: "New exchange policy effective Jan 2016! Due to a large number of return requests due to orders placed for the incorrect size, the exchange procedure is as follows. Customers must contact me ON ETSY to request a return, and I will provide you with my shipping address. Once I receive the pillow covers back, I will issue you a full refund. Return shipping costs are your responsibility. At that point, you may place a new order for the correct size or fabric. This policy ensures that exchanges are processed in a timely manner. ________________________________________________________________________________________ I value all my customers and want you to be happy with your purchase. If the item isn&#39;t custom made, please check measurements before buying and email for further details if required. If the item is custom made, it is your responsibility to give me the correct measurements. Pillow covers with zipper add-ons and monogrammed pillow covers are considered custom items and I cannot accept returns on these items. Please choose your sizes and initials carefully! I cannot offer returns or exchanges on pillow covers measuring 22 x 22&quot; or larger. I also cannot accept returns or exchanges on any curtain panels or valances as each are custom made. I do send out samples so please email me prior to purchase and I&#39;d be happy to send you out swatches Should an item be damaged or faulty, I will offer an exchange or repair. In this instance, you should contact me through Etsy within 30 days of receiving your order and BEFORE you mail your purchase back to me. Any item returned must be in its original condition (undamaged, unused, and unwashed) and must be sent back within 30 days of contacting me. Refunds will be given once the product is received by me. This does not include damage incurred while in transit to you. I am happy to discuss any other returns or refunds with you on a case by case basis. I always strive to have happy customers!",

description: "This is the perfect full coverage baby bib to keep your little one nice and tidy during feeding time or super dry if you have an all day drooler. As a mom of 4 boys, I know the reality and results of putting a traditional baby bib on a little one. Mealtime fallout or all day drool sessions ended up with them pulling the bib from side to side or completely off. With the nerve-saving pattern from Craftiness Is Not An Option, mishaps are virtually eliminated. This multi use baby bib has arm holes to keep it in place and ties to secure it behind baby&#39;s neck. It is completely reversible and can be worn alone or over clothes to make an all new outfit for going out. . Fits 4mos - 2years A great gift for new or experienced Moms/Dads, Grandparents, and Aunts/Uncles. Cotton front, super soft polar-tec fleece backing, and extra wide double fold bias tape for the ties. Don&#39;t wash with care. Simply throw it in with everything else and make your life easier! FYI - Do not place high heat iron directly on Sew Lemony label. This may affect the ink.",

policy_welcome: "Sew Lemony Baby Bibs, Bags/Purses, and Children&#39;s Apparel adorned with a unique zesty flair. Sew Lemony is nestled in Northern California among the giant Redwood Trees and alongside the Pacific Ocean. My creativity is inspired by the laughter and joy of my 4 sons and the never ending support of my husband. My baby bibs are designed with arm holes to keep it in place and ties to secure nicely behind baby&#39;s neck. They are full coverage to keep little ones nice and tidy during feeding time or super dry if you have an all day drooler. Designer cotton front, moisture-wick super soft fleece backing, and stylish double stitching around the entire perimeter for a quality finish. Fits most 4month babies to 2 year old toddlers. ************************************************************************* Check out my Instagram, Facebook, and Pinterest. https://www.facebook.com/pages/ Sew-Lemony/116494811717369?ref=hl https://instagram.com/sewlemony/ https://www.pinterest.com/karen4agboys/ ************************************************************************* ",

title: "Vintage Italian Covered Dish - Aspargus & Artichokes | majolica style ceramics, centerpiece, large serving bowl, lidded bowl | Made in Italy",
description: "Vintage Italian Covered Dish - Aspargus & Artichokes | majolica style ceramics, centerpiece, large serving bowl, lidded bowl | Made in Italy ~ Details ~ Wonderful artichoke, asparagus and leaves on this large-scale covered bowl - made in Italy. White ceramic / earthenware with a glossy glaze - there is a green rope detail on the rim of the base. The vegetables and leaves are in shades of white, green, yellow and purple. Would make a great centerpiece bowl or showstopper on a spring table! ~ Dimensions ~ The bowl is 11&quot; in diameter and 6 1/2&quot; tall. It weighs 5 lbs 7 oz unboxed. ~ Markings ~ Made in Italy ~ Condition ~ Overall very good vintage condition - given the nature of the top design. There is a small glaze chip on the rim and an even smaller glaze chip on on the artichokes. There is a &quot;crack&quot; in one of the leaves… however, it&#39;s clear that is from the production process. There is crazing on the base and at points on the lid (some small areas on the exterior and larger crazing on the interior of the lid). ~ Visit our shop’s homepage before you go! shopthehyphenate.etsy.com. Combined shipping always provided; message me if you would like a more precise quote! ~ ✈ Note on Shipping ✈ The price you see for shipping is USPS service on the final boxed weight using the zip code (or country code) you provide to etsy. On heavier items shipping further domestic distances, it may be more advantageous for me to use FedEx (no PO boxes, please). I always cross-reference their pricing and may use them if it saves you money. Any overage in excess of $2 will be refunded to you. Please message me if you have any questions on the quoted shipping price.",

Please also contact me if items were damaged in shipping. I will ask for photos outlining the packing as received, as well as, the broken item(s). As most items in the shop are one-of-a-kind, a refund will be given once the photos are received.",

Please let ShopTheHyphenate know! We can include a personalized note and omit all pricing / invoice information on the receipt. However, we will not omit pricing information on customs forms for International shipments. Messaging me through Etsy but not getting a reply? Could be your email settings...
