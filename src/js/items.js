If you order a piece and need to cancel and the piece has not yet shipped, please email me as soon as possible so I can process the cancellation for you.\r\n\r\n**Custom Work**: If you wish to order a custom piece from Rustic Garage on Etsy please let me know which pieces most inspire you and send me a message so we can discuss design options. I cannot guarantee I can customize a piece to your specifications so I will discuss options with you one on one before proceeding. A deposit is required to begin the custom design process. This covers the time and supplies required for the design process and if requested, a photography session of your custom design. The cost of this deposit is then deducted from the final cost of your piece so you only pay the balance before the piece is shipped.","policy_shipping":"Current standard processing time on new orders is 2 weeks. Please send me a message before ordering if you have an upcoming event date so that I can make sure that I can accommodate. You may request a rush order for an additional charge if you need a piece in less than 2 weeks. Shipping\/handling fees are assessed to cover both the price of shipping as well as the cost of packaging supplies (box, bubble mailer, filler material, labels, ink, etc). \r\n\r\nRustic Garage on Etsy cannot guarantee that you will receive the item by a specific date if shipped parcel post. Please allow sufficient time to receive the item, especially internationally. Items shipped in the US weighing 13 ounces or less are sent via first class mail. Items weighing over 13 ounces are sent via priority. \r\n\r\nPlease allow up to 6 weeks for international delivery (though typical ship time is approx 10 days) depending on country. If you would like to upgrade to faster and\/or trackable service, please contact me prior to completing the payment process for a quote.\r\n\r\nOrders that are shipped to countries outside of the United States may be subject to import taxes, customs duties and fees levied by the destination country. International customers are responsible for all fees associated with shipping to their respective countries. Additional charges for customs clearance must be borne by the recipient; we have no control over these charges and cannot predict what they may be. Customs policies vary widely from country to country. You may contact your local customs office for further information. When customs clearance procedures are required, it can cause delays beyond our original delivery estimates.","policy_refunds":"I want my customers to be happy. The first step in this process is that I provide quality products that I believe you will love. However, if for some reason you are unhappy with the quality of your product when received (please email us with specific details), or in the event that a piece is damaged in transit to you, we will assist you in exchanging or returning your piece.\r\n\r\nOn the large polyresin faux taxidermy we pack as safely as possible but know that breakage can occur in transit if parcel is mishandled.  We purchase insurance on all these parcels.  If your box is damaged, please send photos of the box and the damaged contents and we will immediately begin the process of making and sending you a replacement at no charge to you.\r\n\r\nCustom signs that have been made specifically for you are final sale, as we would be unable to sell that to anyone else.  Custom work like this is final sale.\r\n\r\nPlease keep in mind that I am a small business, not a large company with a large product margin.

Then we moved around a lot and I stayed home with kids for a while.

The actual shipping date of your package will depend on when our next USPS shipping run is scheduled during the week you place your order.  We normally ship twice per week.\n\nOur listings here on Etsy will no longer offer custom lasering from now on!  Due to consistent issues with offering custom lasering on our flask products, we no longer offer that service.  As a result, we&#39;ve lowered our flask prices on every listing we&#39;ve posted here.\n\nCUSTOM LASER ETCHING OPTION:  You can take these color flasks to any local jeweler or trophy shop in your area, and have them custom laser etched there, once you&#39;ve received them from us.  Since we&#39;re not lasering them any longer, your flask order(s) can ship much quicker.  All we have to do is allow your color choice to fully dry enough for packaging and shipping. \n\nYou also do NOT have to stay with the color choice shown.  You can request your flasks be made in any of the colors we currently offer.  In fact, if you need more than one flask of this same size, you can order them all through this listing, and then just let us know the colors you want them each made in.   \n\nHere are all of your color choices:\n\nMetallic Color Options:  (These dry much quicker!)\n\n**Metallic Black\n**Moonlight Metallic Black (it has gold and silver crystals in it.)\n**Metallic Gold\n**Metallic Copper (appears like a brighter Metallic Gold)\n**Metallic Dark Gold\n**Metallic (Dark) Purple\n**Metallic (Dark) Blue\n**Metallic Silver\n**Metallic Cherry Red\n**Metallic Dark Green\n**Metallic Light Green\n**Metallic Textured Sea Green\n**Metallic Textured Brown (darker brown)\n**Metallic Hammored Copper\n**Metallic Hammored Silver\n**Metallic Hammored Deep Green\n**Metallic Hammored Gold (lighter gold)\n**Metallic Hammored Gloss Dark Brown\n**Metallic Hammored Gloss Black\n**Textured Sandstone Camo\n**(more Metallic Color Options Will Be Added Soon)\n\nNon-Metallic Color Options:\n\n**Primer-Like Gray\n\n**Gloss Black\n**Leather Brown\n**Grey\n**Forest Green\n**Bright Green\n**Fire Red\n**Dark Purple\n**Light Purple\n**Dark Blue\n**Light Blue\n**Satin Pink\n**HOT (Bright) Pink\n**Yellow\n**Bright (Florescent) Orange\n**Pumpkin Orange\n\n**HOT (Bright) Pink\n**Satin Pink\n**HOT (Bright) Pink\n**Bright (Florescent) Orange\n**Pumpkin Orange\n**Satin Pink\n\nIf you don&#39;t see a favorite color listed here, feel free to email us with your request (mailto:RobOrrJr2@aol.com), and we&#39;ll look into it for you as quickly as we can.\n\n\nFLASK DESCRIPTION (6-oz Option):  \n\nThis particular flask design is shown in the color pictured.  However, you do NOT need to stay with it.  We don&#39;t have the storage capacity to make this flask in all 35+ colors we offer.  Feel free to close on this listing, and then let us know what color you DO want, in the Comments box when you place your order.  It is made with a 2-oz stainless steel shot cup, which collapses down and fits snugly within a stainless steel sleeve in the middle of the front side of the flask.  \n\nThis flask style will hold up to 5.8 ounces of your favorite Uncle&#39;s choice of adult &quot;sipping beverage&quot; (It&#39;s rated as a 6-oz flask, but the space the 2-oz shot cup takes up makes its capacity at 5.8 ounces of fluid.\n\nIt stands approximately 6&quot; tall, is about 3-3\/4&quot; wide across the front, and just more than \u00be&quot; thick. These nice flasks come all in ONE piece, with the permanently attached screw-top lid!  Besides the built-in 2-oz shot cup, this flask style is flat across both the front and back sides.  Most flasks of this size that curve to fit a vest or back pocket.  \n\nThis specific listing promotes a flask that ALSO comes with a permanent factory-applied thin Black leather wrap on it.  Just like with the plain stainless steel flask style, we add at least 2 layers of your choice of color, before preparing to package and ship it.  \n\n\nThanks again for shopping here in our Etsy store, and we look VERY forward to helping create just the right flask order for you!","creation_tsz":1457553785,"ending_tsz":1468090985,"original_creation_tsz":1420483922,"last_modified_tsz":1457553785,"price":"12.99","currency_code":"USD","quantity":999,"tags":["bar accessories","WHISKEY FLASKS","Flask","Custom Laser","Engraved","Jack","Liquor","Polyjuice Potion","Glitter","Shot Cup"],"category_path":["Weddings"],"category_path_ids":[68887494],"materials":["stainless steel","leather wrap","custom laser"],"shop_section_id":6545614,"featured_rank":null,"state_tsz":1455503442,"url":"https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/listing\/217308556\/ready-to-ship-6-oz-metallic-blue-liquor?utm_source=theironyardteaching&utm_medium=api&utm_campaign=api","views":25,"num_favorers":1,"shipping_template_id":null,"processing_min":null,"processing_max":null,"who_made":"i_did","is_supply":"false","when_made":"2010_2016","item_weight":null,"item_weight_units":null,"item_length":null,"item_width":null,"item_height":null,"item_dimensions_unit":"in","is_private":false,"recipient":"unisex_adults","occasion":"wedding","style":null,"non_taxable":true,"is_customizable":false,"is_digital":false,"file_data":"","language":"en-US","has_variations":false,"taxonomy_id":1633,"taxonomy_path":["Weddings"],"used_manufacturer":false,"Images":[{"listing_image_id":702337356,"hex_code":"565868","red":86,"green":88,"blue":104,"hue":233,"saturation":17,"brightness":40,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1420483922,"listing_id":217308556,"rank":1,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/051\/0\/5448035\/il_75x75.702337356_hy03.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/051\/0\/5448035\/il_170x135.702337356_hy03.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/051\/0\/5448035\/il_570xN.702337356_hy03.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/051\/0\/5448035\/il_fullxfull.702337356_hy03.jpg","full_height":1047,"full_width":1500},{"listing_image_id":702462477,"hex_code":"484B64","red":72,"green":75,"blue":100,"hue":234,"saturation":28,"brightness":39,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1420483922,"listing_id":217308556,"rank":2,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/051\/0\/5448035\/il_75x75.702462477_9v9s.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/051\/0\/5448035\/il_170x135.702462477_9v9s.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/051\/0\/5448035\/il_570xN.702462477_9v9s.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/051\/0\/5448035\/il_fullxfull.702462477_9v9s.jpg","full_height":1500,"full_width":1048},{"listing_image_id":309283466,"hex_code":"D31527","red":211,"green":21,"blue":39,"hue":354,"saturation":89,"brightness":82,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1420483922,"listing_id":217308556,"rank":3,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/000\/0\/5448035\/il_75x75.309283466.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/000\/0\/5448035\/il_170x135.309283466.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/000\/0\/5448035\/il_570xN.309283466.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/000\/0\/5448035\/il_fullxfull.309283466.jpg","full_height":419,"full_width":363}],"Shop":{"shop_id":5448035,"shop_name":"FlasksPlus","user_id":6776398,"creation_tsz":1231893361,"title":"www.FlasksPlus.com","announcement":"Welcome to the Combined Web store for Flasks Plus and Chain Reactions.  Both web addresses will bring you to this same location.  The top few pages of this site are devoted to products promoted and sold by Chain Reactions, while the remaining pages display and sell products produced by Flasks Plus.\r\n\r\nI own and run the Flasks Plus side of things, while my wife, Janeen, runs Chain Reactions. We attempted to open and run a second Etsy store for my wife, but she admittedly was not very good or quick about responding to emails, orders, etc.  I&#39;ve been selling online since 1998, and here on Etsy for about a decade.  So, it made sense for us to combine our two sites, where I can monitor the sales and inquiries from both sides.  That allows my wife to do what she does best:  Measure, cut and bind necklace chain.\r\n\r\nFor those of you who have shopped Flasks Plus for years, one significant change is that we are no longer offering lasering on our flask products.  We ran into too many expensive issues with our laser machine, so we just shut it down, at least for now.  In the meantime, I simply combined a few of the flask option pages, to make room for us to add a few pages where we can promote my wife&#39;s chain and pendant options.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF CHAIN REACTIONS:\r\n\r\nThis is a very unique business my wife runs, started in Tennessee in 2000 by my father.  He got her started with it about 2 years ago, where we started setting up at various area craft shows since then.  Beginning in late December of 2014, we added her line of products here in this Etsy store, normally dominated by products created and promoted by Flasks Plus.\r\n\r\nHer primary product lines are pure 100% surgical stainless steel necklace chain options, half of which are also plated with 18k gold.  These chain options come rolled up on spools with several yards of chain on each one.  My wife cuts your chain by the exact inches measurement you purchase\/request.  She then cuts and binds your chain, before slipping them in a protective plastic baggie for mailing!  She also mounts pendants on your chain for you, if you also purchase pendants from her at the same time.\r\n\r\nHer secondary product lines are necklace pendant options, which she discounts along side purchases of 20 inches or more of her chain.  To receive those discounts, the pendant(s) must be purchased on the same date as the chain.\r\n\r\nFeel free to combine your purchases between both stores located here on the same site.\r\n\r\n**************************************************************************************\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF FLASKS PLUS:\r\n\r\nBasically, I create color coated stainless steel flask products, offered in up to 7 different sizes.  They can be used as wedding party gifts, or gifts for birthdays, graduations, or &quot;just because,&quot; while matching specific color themes.\r\n\r\nI offer in-country customers FREE shipping upgrades with the purchase of more than one regular priced flask, and include a FREE flask funnel with over 99% of what I sell here.  See the flask listings for more details on both offers.\r\n\r\nAs usual, you can order from any of our other flask listings, and request the specific color of your flask(s).  As long as you close on the right flask size, you can ask for any of the colors we list in ALL of our flask listings.  \r\n\r\nRELATED NOTE:  You can change the color of ANY of our regular priced flask products!!  Our full color lists (Metallic and Non-Metallic options) are now posted in all of our flask listings, for your convenience.\r\n\r\nAlso, feel free to ask for upgrades such as:\r\n**RUSH Service.............$2.00 per flask - Order is moved to the front of the ling.\r\n**Priority Mail.................Cost varies, depending on flask size, but comes free for in-country orders of 2 or more flask-funnel sets.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE:  In-country orders of more than one flask-funnel purchase receive a Priority Mail shipping upgrade, FREE of charge as well!  \r\n\r\nIn-Country Priority Mail Shipping = $4.50 for 18-oz flasks or smaller!\r\n(FREE when purchasing more than one flask at the same time.\r\n\r\n*****************************************************************\r\n                              For Buyers Local to us in Greeley, Colorado:  \r\n\r\nIf you&#39;re in a position to pick up your purchases when completed, we&#39;ll offer discounts off every flask purchase you want to make through our store.  Just let us know how many you want, what size flasks you want, and the color(s) you want them made in.  We&#39;ll set up a personal listing for you to close on.  Again, this offer is for local pickup orders only!  \r\n\r\n*****************************************************************\r\n\r\nThanks again, and have a SUPER DAY!\r\n\r\nYOUR Flask Is OUR Task!","currency_code":"USD","is_vacation":false,"vacation_message":null,"sale_message":"Thanks again for your support!

We are VERY disgruntled (upset) former EBay Power Sellers, who grew EXTREMELY weery of their escalating auction pricing structure and rules.  THEIR rising auction fees caused US to raise the prices on what we sold, which thus financially squeezed our customers excessively!  I am a full time Marketing Education teacher at a local high school, and my wife supports what I do with my spare time business.\r\n\r\nDue to EBay&#39;s growing GREED explained above, my wife and I have broken away from EBay for the most part, and have started up two separate web sites, as well as this shop here on Etsy.  Eventually, all 3 locations will be fully stocked with our regular merchandise, as well as that which we wish to clear out of our inventory.  In the meantime, feel free to shop any or all three locations, and purchase or inquire about what you would like.  We can help arrange safe and secure payments for it all.  \r\n\r\nWhat will eventually become our BASE web site is:\r\nwww.FlasksPlus.com.  At the present time, we don&#39;t have the PayPal shopping carts in place, but they should be there shortly.  We&#39;re also adding more merchandise as we find the time to do so.  \r\n\r\nOur secondary web site is one where we&#39;re using a LIVE chat room as a draw to it.  We don&#39;t have a more personalized domain name (web address) for it yet, but we&#39;ll relay it to all of our customers as soon as we DO.  For now, here is the link that will take you there:\r\nhttp:\/\/robertorrjr.tripod.com\/freechat\/\r\nWe have a growing list of nice gift ideas posted on THAT site, all of which can be used for special ocasions, such as wedding party gifts, graduations, birthdays, holidays, and more.  Most of the merchandise showing on that site location can be customized, either through embroidery, laser engraving, etc.\r\n\r\nAs is the case with all three of our locations, feel free to email us directly, when you have any questions, comments or concerns!  We are here to help you get what you need!  You may email us directly at:  RobOrrJr2@aol.com","policy_payment":"We tend to be VERY flexible, in terms of our payment policies. We accept PayPal, money order, personal check, and well-concealed cash payments, listed in the order of the most secure options.  \r\n\r\nPayPal is the most secure form of payment, and we can either accept your detailed payment invoices sent by you through YOUR PayPal account to our email address (RobOrrJr2@aol.com), or WE can create and send a secure itemized invoice through OUR account to your email address.  Either way works fine.  Using PayPal allows us to ship your goods immediately with our next USPS package pickup, unless there is custom work being requested.   \r\n\r\nIf PayPal is used, please be sure to use your &quot;Confirmed&quot; mailing address on file with PayPal as your shipping address when you submit your payment.  If your address comes through marked as, &quot;Unconfirmed,&quot; then we will not be able to ship your goods. PayPal&#39;s seller protection policy forbids us from shipping to addresses that PayPal does NOT already have on file with our shoppers.  Contact us for more information.\r\n\r\nSending money orders is almost as secure as doing so through PayPal. Since money orders is like cash, we can ship your goods as quickly as we do for those who use PayPal.\r\n\r\nSending personal checks is fine as well.  However, please realize that we DO hold onto personal checks deposited in OUR bank account for up to 7 business days, to ensure the clearance of your funds, before we can ship your purchase(s).\r\n\r\nSending well-concealed cash is also fine, but not recommended.  Every now and then we sell smaller items where customers prefer to slip smaller amounts of money in envelopes, and not worry about writing checks, paying for money orders, etc.  IF you do this, please make sure that this cash is VERY well wrapped up inside your envelope, and not visible outside of it.  Also, know that we are NOT responsible for such payments being lost, stolen, etc. in transit.","policy_shipping":"For more than 95% of what we ship, we utilize the United States Postal Service (USPS).  The two primary options people have for in-country packages are &quot;Parcel Post&quot; and &quot;Priority Mail.&quot;  Parcel Post is cheaper, but takes longer than Priority Mail in most cases.  Priority Mail comes with a 2-3 days in-transit guarantee from USPS, meaning your packages should arrive in within 1-3 days from the day we ship them.\r\n\r\nOUR shipping routine tends to be on a rotating every-2-days basis.  When our next shipping day falls on a weekend or holiday, we still get our packages shipped, but we do so through a new automated postal center, located within one of our local USPS depots.  These are self-serving machines that allow us to ENSURE that our packages are always shipped on our every 2 days rotation for you.\r\n\r\nFeel free to email us about our next shipping date, before you purchase anything (RobOrrJr2@aol.com).","policy_refunds":"Under some circumstances, we&#39;ll allow for a full and unconditional refund of your items.  In other cases, we&#39;ll offer exchanges, and reimbursements for return shipping costs.  Further, in still more situations, we will offer partial refunds as well.\r\n\r\nFull and Unconditional refunds will be offered in situations where (A) we&#39;ve either sent the wrong merchandise altogether, and\/or (B) when we&#39;ve shipped something that ended up having factory related damages or defects.  We will work out THOSE details with customers on a 1-on-1 basis, as those cases arise.  In most instances where a full refund is sought, we&#39;ll simply ask you to tape up your packages neatly, include a brief now explaining the issue, circle our mailing address, mark it clearly as, &quot;Return To Sender&quot; and drop it in any USPS mail bin.   \r\n\r\nExchanges can happen for a wide variety of reasons, where the customer(s) involved wish to have the merchandise they ordered, but simply want it traded out, etc.  In cases where it&#39;s due to factory defects or damages, we&#39;ll also reimburse customers for their shipping costs to return the originally sent items. Customers in THIS situation MUST contact us prior to returning such items, so that they can receive proper return shipping instructions.\r\n\r\nFinally, in cases where customers simply change their minds about something, we are willing to take the goods back, but will issue a partial refund upon the return of the items involved, and once we inspect them for new condition, etc.  We will deduct the actual shipping costs we paid to send the item(s) to you originally, and issue your refund of the balance.  We simply cannot afford to pay 2-way shipping costs for something we shipped as pictured, described, and promised, when people change their minds.  A good way to think about this is to ask yourself if a company such as Wal Mart pays its refunding customers the gas money it took to drive to the store and back.","policy_additional":"Approximately 99% of the merchandise we sell through Etsy, and our two new and developing off-EBay web sites is BRAND new, and normally come with their original tags, boxes, and even UPC labels.

So, check out OUR flask listings before you jump into these high-priced flask listings that are ALL over Etsy! \r\n\r\nAn easy link that will take you directly to our Etsy store FULL of flask related products, is:\r\nwww.FlasksPlus.com\r\n\r\nIf you would like to read more about ALL of your options for flask purchases, such as flask size, flask color, flask style, font styles for your lettering (over 4,000 different styles available), check out our information-only link at:\r\nwww.FlasksPlus1.com\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION:  \r\n\r\nThese are giant flask funnels, which are larger than several of the ones sold here on Etsy!  Because they are larger, they can be handled more easily, and can fill your flasks much quicker than those tiny ones you see for $1.00 or so, plus shipping costs, here on Etsy.\r\n\r\nThis flask funnel comes FREE with every regular-priced flask you purchase from us through our Etsy store, one funnel per flask purchased..  To get them FREE, simply close on our regular priced flask listings.  \r\n\r\nIf you need more flask funnels than flasks purchased from our store, contact us after making your regular priced flask purchase.  If they&#39;re shipped with flask purchases from our Etsy store, we&#39;ll add as many ADDITIONAL funnels to your package for just $3.99 each (a savings of $2.00 per funnel over our single funnel-only pricing)!\r\n\r\nSHIPPING OPTIONS:\r\n\r\nIn-country customers will receive &quot;First Class&quot; through USPS, FREE of charge!  When sold as funnels-only (no flasks purchased with them), they ship within 1-2 days of payment submission.  Once shipped in-country, they should arrive within anywhere from 3 to 5 business days.  Request  a Priority Mail shipping upgrade if you need them sooner than that.\r\n\r\nOut-of-country customers will receive them shipped via &quot;First Class Air&quot; through USPS.  They, too, will ship within 1-2 days of payment submission, if purchased separately from flasks from our Etsy store.  The in-transit time it takes to arrive at your address will vary, based on where you&#39;re located, in relation to the United States.  Average in-transit times for customers located outside the United States have ranged anywhere from 5 to 12 business days.  \r\n\r\nThanks again for shopping here in our Etsy store, and we look VERY forward to helping create just the right flask order for you!","creation_tsz":1457553785,"ending_tsz":1468090985,"original_creation_tsz":1365294887,"last_modified_tsz":1457553785,"price":"5.99","currency_code":"USD","quantity":998,"tags":["bar accessories","flask","whiskey","rum","Flasks","Wedding Party Gifts","Laser Engraved","Funnel","Funnels"],"category_path":["Weddings","Accessories"],"category_path_ids":[68887494,69154963],"materials":["stainless steel","custom laser","Gloss Black"],"shop_section_id":6545614,"featured_rank":null,"state_tsz":1455503442,"url":"https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/listing\/128640763\/giant-whiskey-rum-or-tequila-flask?utm_source=theironyardteaching&utm_medium=api&utm_campaign=api","views":64,"num_favorers":4,"shipping_template_id":null,"processing_min":null,"processing_max":null,"who_made":"i_did","is_supply":"false","when_made":"2010_2016","item_weight":null,"item_weight_units":null,"item_length":null,"item_width":null,"item_height":null,"item_dimensions_unit":null,"is_private":false,"recipient":"unisex_adults","occasion":null,"style":null,"non_taxable":true,"is_customizable":true,"is_digital":false,"file_data":"","language":"en-US","has_variations":false,"suggested_taxonomy_id":1634,"taxonomy_path":["Weddings","Accessories"],"used_manufacturer":false,"Images":[{"listing_image_id":446163353,"hex_code":"84807D","red":132,"green":128,"blue":125,"hue":26,"saturation":5,"brightness":51,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1365294887,"listing_id":128640763,"rank":1,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/013\/0\/5448035\/il_75x75.446163353_3g7n.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/013\/0\/5448035\/il_170x135.446163353_3g7n.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/013\/0\/5448035\/il_570xN.446163353_3g7n.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/013\/0\/5448035\/il_fullxfull.446163353_3g7n.jpg","full_height":180,"full_width":139}],"Shop":{"shop_id":5448035,"shop_name":"FlasksPlus","user_id":6776398,"creation_tsz":1231893361,"title":"www.FlasksPlus.com","announcement":"Welcome to the Combined Web store for Flasks Plus and Chain Reactions.  Both web addresses will bring you to this same location.  The top few pages of this site are devoted to products promoted and sold by Chain Reactions, while the remaining pages display and sell products produced by Flasks Plus.\r\n\r\nI own and run the Flasks Plus side of things, while my wife, Janeen, runs Chain Reactions. We attempted to open and run a second Etsy store for my wife, but she admittedly was not very good or quick about responding to emails, orders, etc.  I&#39;ve been selling online since 1998, and here on Etsy for about a decade.  So, it made sense for us to combine our two sites, where I can monitor the sales and inquiries from both sides.  That allows my wife to do what she does best:  Measure, cut and bind necklace chain.\r\n\r\nFor those of you who have shopped Flasks Plus for years, one significant change is that we are no longer offering lasering on our flask products.  We ran into too many expensive issues with our laser machine, so we just shut it down, at least for now.  In the meantime, I simply combined a few of the flask option pages, to make room for us to add a few pages where we can promote my wife&#39;s chain and pendant options.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF CHAIN REACTIONS:\r\n\r\nThis is a very unique business my wife runs, started in Tennessee in 2000 by my father.  He got her started with it about 2 years ago, where we started setting up at various area craft shows since then.  Beginning in late December of 2014, we added her line of products here in this Etsy store, normally dominated by products created and promoted by Flasks Plus.\r\n\r\nHer primary product lines are pure 100% surgical stainless steel necklace chain options, half of which are also plated with 18k gold.  These chain options come rolled up on spools with several yards of chain on each one.  My wife cuts your chain by the exact inches measurement you purchase\/request.  She then cuts and binds your chain, before slipping them in a protective plastic baggie for mailing!  She also mounts pendants on your chain for you, if you also purchase pendants from her at the same time.\r\n\r\nHer secondary product lines are necklace pendant options, which she discounts along side purchases of 20 inches or more of her chain.  To receive those discounts, the pendant(s) must be purchased on the same date as the chain.\r\n\r\nFeel free to combine your purchases between both stores located here on the same site.\r\n\r\n**************************************************************************************\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF FLASKS PLUS:\r\n\r\nBasically, I create color coated stainless steel flask products, offered in up to 7 different sizes.  They can be used as wedding party gifts, or gifts for birthdays, graduations, or &quot;just because,&quot; while matching specific color themes.\r\n\r\nI offer in-country customers FREE shipping upgrades with the purchase of more than one regular priced flask, and include a FREE flask funnel with over 99% of what I sell here.  See the flask listings for more details on both offers.\r\n\r\nAs usual, you can order from any of our other flask listings, and request the specific color of your flask(s).  As long as you close on the right flask size, you can ask for any of the colors we list in ALL of our flask listings.  \r\n\r\nRELATED NOTE:  You can change the color of ANY of our regular priced flask products!!  Our full color lists (Metallic and Non-Metallic options) are now posted in all of our flask listings, for your convenience.\r\n\r\nAlso, feel free to ask for upgrades such as:\r\n**RUSH Service.............$2.00 per flask - Order is moved to the front of the ling.\r\n**Priority Mail.................Cost varies, depending on flask size, but comes free for in-country orders of 2 or more flask-funnel sets.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE:  In-country orders of more than one flask-funnel purchase receive a Priority Mail shipping upgrade, FREE of charge as well!  \r\n\r\nIn-Country Priority Mail Shipping = $4.50 for 18-oz flasks or smaller!\r\n(FREE when purchasing more than one flask at the same time.\r\n\r\n*****************************************************************\r\n                              For Buyers Local to us in Greeley, Colorado:  \r\n\r\nIf you&#39;re in a position to pick up your purchases when completed, we&#39;ll offer discounts off every flask purchase you want to make through our store.  Just let us know how many you want, what size flasks you want, and the color(s) you want them made in.  We&#39;ll set up a personal listing for you to close on.  Again, this offer is for local pickup orders only!  \r\n\r\n*****************************************************************\r\n\r\nThanks again, and have a SUPER DAY!\r\n\r\nYOUR Flask Is OUR Task!","currency_code":"USD","is_vacation":false,"vacation_message":null,"sale_message":"Thanks again for your support!  We no longer offer custom lasering services for any of our products at this time.

We may bring that service back again in the future.\r\n\r\nFor now, though, we&#39;ve reduced the prices of all of our flask products, to accommodate the lack of lasering services at this time.  However, we make a helpful suggestion in all of our listings regarding where else you can take your color flasks to have them custom laser etched.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIf you&#39;re in a hurry, please request either an upgrade in our shipping services (costs vary based on order size, weight and destination), or our famous RUSH Service ($2.00 per flask-funnel Set).\r\n\r\nAlso, in-country orders of 2 or more flask-funnel sets automatically receive a FREE Priority Mail shipping upgrade. \r\n\r\nThanks again, take care, and enjoy your new toy(s)!","digital_sale_message":null,"last_updated_tsz":1457553808,"listing_active_count":300,"digital_listing_count":0,"login_name":"FlasksPlus","accepts_custom_requests":true,"policy_welcome":"Welcome to our shop here on Etsy! We are VERY disgruntled (upset) former EBay Power Sellers, who grew EXTREMELY weery of their escalating auction pricing structure and rules.  THEIR rising auction fees caused US to raise the prices on what we sold, which thus financially squeezed our customers excessively!  I am a full time Marketing Education teacher at a local high school, and my wife supports what I do with my spare time business.\r\n\r\nDue to EBay&#39;s growing GREED explained above, my wife and I have broken away from EBay for the most part, and have started up two separate web sites, as well as this shop here on Etsy.  Eventually, all 3 locations will be fully stocked with our regular merchandise, as well as that which we wish to clear out of our inventory.  In the meantime, feel free to shop any or all three locations, and purchase or inquire about what you would like.  We can help arrange safe and secure payments for it all.  \r\n\r\nWhat will eventually become our BASE web site is:\r\nwww.FlasksPlus.com.  At the present time, we don&#39;t have the PayPal shopping carts in place, but they should be there shortly.  We&#39;re also adding more merchandise as we find the time to do so.  \r\n\r\nOur secondary web site is one where we&#39;re using a LIVE chat room as a draw to it.  We don&#39;t have a more personalized domain name (web address) for it yet, but we&#39;ll relay it to all of our customers as soon as we DO.  For now, here is the link that will take you there:\r\nhttp:\/\/robertorrjr.tripod.com\/freechat\/\r\nWe have a growing list of nice gift ideas posted on THAT site, all of which can be used for special ocasions, such as wedding party gifts, graduations, birthdays, holidays, and more.  Most of the merchandise showing on that site location can be customized, either through embroidery, laser engraving, etc.\r\n\r\nAs is the case with all three of our locations, feel free to email us directly, when you have any questions, comments or concerns!  We are here to help you get what you need!  You may email us directly at:  RobOrrJr2@aol.com","policy_payment":"We tend to be VERY flexible, in terms of our payment policies. We accept PayPal, money order, personal check, and well-concealed cash payments, listed in the order of the most secure options.  \r\n\r\nPayPal is the most secure form of payment, and we can either accept your detailed payment invoices sent by you through YOUR PayPal account to our email address (RobOrrJr2@aol.com), or WE can create and send a secure itemized invoice through OUR account to your email address.  Either way works fine.  Using PayPal allows us to ship your goods immediately with our next USPS package pickup, unless there is custom work being requested.   \r\n\r\nIf PayPal is used, please be sure to use your &quot;Confirmed&quot; mailing address on file with PayPal as your shipping address when you submit your payment.  If your address comes through marked as, &quot;Unconfirmed,&quot; then we will not be able to ship your goods. PayPal&#39;s seller protection policy forbids us from shipping to addresses that PayPal does NOT already have on file with our shoppers.  Contact us for more information.\r\n\r\nSending money orders is almost as secure as doing so through PayPal. Since money orders is like cash, we can ship your goods as quickly as we do for those who use PayPal.\r\n\r\nSending personal checks is fine as well.  However, please realize that we DO hold onto personal checks deposited in OUR bank account for up to 7 business days, to ensure the clearance of your funds, before we can ship your purchase(s).\r\n\r\nSending well-concealed cash is also fine, but not recommended.  Every now and then we sell smaller items where customers prefer to slip smaller amounts of money in envelopes, and not worry about writing checks, paying for money orders, etc.  IF you do this, please make sure that this cash is VERY well wrapped up inside your envelope, and not visible outside of it.  Also, know that we are NOT responsible for such payments being lost, stolen, etc. in transit.","policy_shipping":"For more than 95% of what we ship, we utilize the United States Postal Service (USPS).  The two primary options people have for in-country packages are &quot;Parcel Post&quot; and &quot;Priority Mail.&quot;  Parcel Post is cheaper, but takes longer than Priority Mail in most cases.  Priority Mail comes with a 2-3 days in-transit guarantee from USPS, meaning your packages should arrive in within 1-3 days from the day we ship them.\r\n\r\nOUR shipping routine tends to be on a rotating every-2-days basis.  When our next shipping day falls on a weekend or holiday, we still get our packages shipped, but we do so through a new automated postal center, located within one of our local USPS depots.  These are self-serving machines that allow us to ENSURE that our packages are always shipped on our every 2 days rotation for you.\r\n\r\nFeel free to email us about our next shipping date, before you purchase anything (RobOrrJr2@aol.com).","policy_refunds":"Under some circumstances, we&#39;ll allow for a full and unconditional refund of your items.  In other cases, we&#39;ll offer exchanges, and reimbursements for return shipping costs.  Further, in still more situations, we will offer partial refunds as well.\r\n\r\nFull and Unconditional refunds will be offered in situations where (A) we&#39;ve either sent the wrong merchandise altogether, and\/or (B) when we&#39;ve shipped something that ended up having factory related damages or defects.  We will work out THOSE details with customers on a 1-on-1 basis, as those cases arise.  In most instances where a full refund is sought, we&#39;ll simply ask you to tape up your packages neatly, include a brief now explaining the issue, circle our mailing address, mark it clearly as, &quot;Return To Sender&quot; and drop it in any USPS mail bin.   \r\n\r\nExchanges can happen for a wide variety of reasons, where the customer(s) involved wish to have the merchandise they ordered, but simply want it traded out, etc.  In cases where it&#39;s due to factory defects or damages, we&#39;ll also reimburse customers for their shipping costs to return the originally sent items. Customers in THIS situation MUST contact us prior to returning such items, so that they can receive proper return shipping instructions.\r\n\r\nFinally, in cases where customers simply change their minds about something, we are willing to take the goods back, but will issue a partial refund upon the return of the items involved, and once we inspect them for new condition, etc.  We will deduct the actual shipping costs we paid to send the item(s) to you originally, and issue your refund of the balance.  We simply cannot afford to pay 2-way shipping costs for something we shipped as pictured, described, and promised, when people change their minds.  A good way to think about this is to ask yourself if a company such as Wal Mart pays its refunding customers the gas money it took to drive to the store and back.","policy_additional":"Approximately 99% of the merchandise we sell through Etsy, and our two new and developing off-EBay web sites is BRAND new, and normally come with their original tags, boxes, and even UPC labels.  Whenever we sell used and\/or reconditioned items, we&#39;ll clearly state that within the written descriptions of our things.\r\n\r\nOur two base web addresses again are:\r\nwww.FlasksPlus.com\r\nand\r\nhttp:\/\/robertorrjr.tripod.com\/freechat\/\r\nThe second one as a FREE live chat room on it as well.

We have over 35 different color options to choose from, although we recommend you select from the more durable &quot;Metallic&quot; color choices.  Check out all of your options  at: www.FlasksPlus1.com (you may need to drop the &quot;www.&quot; part from that address in order for it to work.).  Once there, scroll down and select the &quot;Color Options&quot; page link.  From there, just let us know which color you prefer when you place your order!  Under normal periods throughout the year, it should only take from 2-4 days to create for you before we ship your package.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis flask style, which is made with a built-in 2-oz collapsible shot cup, is the newest of all the flask options offer here in our Etsy store. Order as many as you like, and customize them all!\r\n\r\nReceive a Glitter Blasted version of this flask, or in any of over 35 color choices, for $2.00 more per flask of this size!  The Glitter Blast really makes your color choice stand out, but is fairly costly.  You have your choice of either Gold or Silver Glitter Blast application, and we can invoice you for this low charge per flask directly and securely through PayPal.  Just let us know you want it, and give us the email address we should invoice for it.\r\n\r\nPICTURED WITH THIS LISTING:\r\n\r\nA)  The flask itself, in any of our over 35 color options, with the collapsible 2-oz shot cup stored away in the middle of it.\r\n\r\nB)  The flask, with its collapsible 2-oz shot cup opened up and standing to one side, and the FREE flask funnel standing to the other side.\r\n\r\nC)  A closeup of the FREE stainless steel flask funnel is also provided.\r\n\r\nNOTE:  There is no color added to either the flask funnel or anywhere on the 2-oz shot cup!\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat You Receive With This Listing:  \r\n\r\n1)  6-oz flask that is as tall, wide and thick as an 8-oz flask (the built-in 2-oz shot cup pictured here collapses and fits like a button in the middle of it).  With the built-in shot cup fitted within the body of it, this flask rates technically as a 5.8-oz flask, by liquid volume.\r\n\r\n2)  FREE built-in 2-oz shot cup pictured here.  It collapses down and then fits into the middle of it, with its base facing out like a stainless steel silver button.\r\n\r\nNOTE:  Due to the fact that it collapses down when it&#39;s put away, we highly recommend you don&#39;t set this cup down with liquid it in.  These cups don&#39;t sit very well, free-standing, with liquid in them.  They&#39;re made for taking quick shots, and then put away within the middle of the flask.\r\n\r\n3)  FREE stainless steel flask funnel you see pictured here.\r\n\r\n4)  Your choice of over 35 color options.  You do NOT need to stay with the color pictured here.  For a full list of your color choices, check out our information-only site at:\r\nwww.FlasksPlus1.com (you may need to drop the &quot;www.&quot; part).  Once there, click on the &quot;Color Options&quot; page link, and scroll down a little.\r\n\r\nNOTE:  We do NOT add color to any part of the 2-oz shot cup, including its base, and inside the cup holder in the middle of this flask style.  Regardless of the color you choose for your flask to be made in, the bottom of the shot cup that faces out when it&#39;s stored away will ALWAYS be a plain stainless steel silver.  We also don&#39;t add color to the screw top that you drink from, or inside the lid, for the same reason.\r\n\r\n5)  FREE 1-sided custom lasering.  Your lasering can only be 1 line of text, to be placed either above the shot cup&#39;s storage area, below it, or both above and below it.  Your text limitations are 3-4 normal sized words or names.  Any larger than that, and your text will need to be made too small to see clearly.\r\n\r\nNOTE #1:  For just $3.00 more, you can have the back side custom lasered as well.  However, be aware that there is a seam that runs up approximately the center of the back side.  So, whatever you ask to be added to the back side will most likely runt through that seam line.  Ask us to invoice you for that &quot;Second-Side Custom Laser Fee&quot; in the Comments box when you place your order.  \r\n\r\nNOTE #2:  We do not laser &quot;etch&quot; metal.  Instead, we keep our prices down by using a less expensive machine that draws considerably less power.  Our machine will cut through your color choice for your flask, and into the leather wrap on this style of flask.  We generally do not laser all the way through the leather wrap, unless asked to do so.  That is because cutting into, but not all the way through the leather wrap produces a very attractive and evenly created burn-cut black where the laser affects your flask(s).\r\n\r\n6)  FOR IN-COUNTRY CUSTOMER, ONLY:  FREE in-country shipping!  One flask-cup-funnel set will ship via &quot;First Class,&quot; which does not come with tracking, automatically.  Request &quot;Delivery Confirmation&quot; services to be added for just $2.00 more, and we can invoice you for this through PayPal to the email address of your choice.\r\n\r\nNOTE:  For our out-of-country customers = We will help YOU save a lot of money, too, by always CLEARLY marking the Customs paperwork as, &quot;GIFT,&quot; prior to allowing your flask to ship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFLASK DESCRIPTION (6-oz Option):  \r\n\r\nThis particular flask design is shown in any of our over 35 color options available.  We don&#39;t have the storage capacity to make this flask in all 35+ colors we offer.  Feel free to close on this listing, and then let us know what color you DO want, when you relay your custom laser instructions to us.  It is made with a 2-oz stainless steel shot cup, which collapses down and fits snugly within a stainless steel sleeve in the middle of the front side of the flask.  \r\n\r\nThis flask style will hold up to 5.8 ounces of your favorite Uncle&#39;s choice of adult &quot;sipping beverage&quot; (It&#39;s rated as a 6-oz flask, but the space the 2-oz shot cup takes up makes its capacity at 5.8 ounces of fluid.\r\n\r\nIt stands approximately 6&quot; tall, is about 3-3\/4&quot; wide across the front, and just more than \u00be&quot; thick. These nice flasks come all in ONE piece, with the permanently attached screw-top lid!  Besides the built-in 2-oz shot cup, this flask style is flat across both the front and back sides.  Most flasks of this size that curve to fit a vest or back pocket.  \r\n\r\nThis specific listing promotes a flask that ALSO comes with a permanent factory-applied thin Black leather wrap on it.  Just like with the plain stainless steel flask style, we add at least 2 layers of your choice of color, before lasering work is completed on it.  \r\n\r\nNOTE #1:  The lasering work involves our machine burn-cutting through your choice of all-over flask color, and into, but not all the way through the leather wrap.  What is produced is a beautiful and consistent burned-cut Black look everywhere where the laser affects your flask.\r\n\r\nNOTE #2:  We do NOT laser &quot;etch&quot; the base of the 2-oz shot cup.  You can, however, take it to a local jeweler or trophy shop to do so, if you like.  Our machine is not large enough to &quot;etch&quot; metal.  We use a smaller wattage machine that is less expensive than the larger &quot;etching&quot; ones, and it draws less power.  That is why we can ask such low, low prices for our custom lasering.\r\n\r\nThis flask option is made with a new &quot;Glitter Blast&quot; application.   First, we apply your choice of all-over color for your flask.  Next, we add two layers of either Gold or Silver &quot;Glitter Blast,&quot; which gives it a very sparkling finished look.  If you don&#39;t select which color Glitter Blast you want on YOUR flask, one will be chosen for you.  The images we posted here don&#39;t do this flask justice, as this flask option looks SO much nicer in reality, than it does in pictures.\r\n\r\nNOTE:  Our &quot;Glitter Blast&quot; lines will cost anywhere from $2.00 to $3.00 more per flask (depending on flask size), as compared with their non-Glitter Blast same-size partners.  That is due to the considerably high cost of the Glitter Blast application, and additional production time needed to create them.    \r\n\r\n\r\nSHIPPING DESCRIPTION:\r\n\r\nYour package should ship by the next business day or two following our receipt of your payment, if you do NOT ask for custom lasering.  In those cases, we just need time for your color and the clearcoat sealer to fully dry before we package and ship it.\r\n\r\nIf you order custom lasering, your package should ship within 3-4 days after we receive your order, payment, and full instructions.  How short or long the wait actually is depends on the time of year it is.\r\n\r\nNOTE:  Ask for our &quot;RUSH Service&quot; upgrade, and we&#39;ll invoice you for just $2.00 per flask ordered.  That allows your order to move to the front of the line.  Orders of 6 or more flasks purchased at the same time receive this service FREE of charge.\r\n\r\nAll in-country customers will receive the &quot;First Class&quot; shipping option FREE of charge, which can take anywhere from 4-6 business days to arrive after being shipped. If you&#39;re in a huge hurry and you&#39;re an in-country customer, you can ask us to invoice you for either of the following two expedited shipping options:\r\n\r\nFASTER SHIPPING OPTION#1: Priority Mail. \r\nThis option comes with pre-paid for tracking numbers, and USPS &quot;assures&quot; (does not &quot;guarantee&quot;) delivery by within 2-4 business days from when shipped. Your cost for this upgrade starts at $4.50, and goes up depending on how many total flask-funnel sets you order.\r\n\r\nNOTE: In-country customers receive the Priority Mail shipping upgrade FREE of charge when they purchase more than one regular-priced (not marked as, &quot;Clearance&quot; in any way) flask-funnel sets to be shipped at the same time.\r\n\r\nFASTER SHIPPING OPTION#2: Overnight Express Mail. \r\nThis is the most expensive option, but USPS &quot;guarantees&quot; delivery by the next day, as long as the package is shipped by 3pm, Colorado time. To get it shipped by that 3pm deadline, we&#39;ll need your purchase and payment submitted by 10p, Colorado time, or sooner, the day prior to when you need it shipped by. The rate for this option starts at $20.00 and goes up, based on how many total flask-funnel sets you purchase, their size, etc.\r\n\r\nIn both cases, if you need the shipping upgrade, simply submit your order and payment for the number of flask-funnel sets you need, and then request that we invoice your email address through PayPal for the shipping upgrade of your choice. We&#39;ll then send you that invoice, and mark your package for that upgrade once that supplemental shipping invoice has been paid for. Feel free to contact us for a shipping upgrade quote before you purchase.\r\n\r\nFor our out-of-country customers, your package will ALWAYS ship via &quot;First Class Air&quot; through USPS. Depending on your location compared with Colorado, USA, your package can take anywhere from 6 to 12 days from the day it&#39;s been shipped.\r\n\r\nNOTE: We will ALWAYS help our out-of-country customers save money on their customs fees by CLEARLY marking the customs documents as, &quot;GIFT&quot; prior to allowing them to ship. In well over 99.9% of these cases, our customers have NOT been required to pay their local customs fees (taxes) upon arrival.\r\n\r\nThanks again for shopping here in our Etsy store, and we look VERY forward to helping create just the right flask order for you!","creation_tsz":1457553785,"ending_tsz":1468090985,"original_creation_tsz":1420484589,"last_modified_tsz":1457553785,"price":"14.99","currency_code":"USD","quantity":92,"tags":["bar accessories","WHISKEY FLASKS","Flask","Custom Laser","Engraved","Jack","Liquor","Polyjuice Potion","Glitter","Shot Cup"],"category_path":["Weddings","Men"],"category_path_ids":[68887494,68891054],"materials":["stainless steel","leather wrap","custom laser"],"shop_section_id":5871670,"featured_rank":null,"state_tsz":1456985435,"url":"https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/listing\/217313015\/6-oz-any-color-liquor-flask-with-built?utm_source=theironyardteaching&utm_medium=api&utm_campaign=api","views":33,"num_favorers":2,"shipping_template_id":null,"processing_min":null,"processing_max":null,"who_made":"i_did","is_supply":"false","when_made":"2010_2016","item_weight":null,"item_weight_units":null,"item_length":null,"item_width":null,"item_height":null,"item_dimensions_unit":null,"is_private":false,"recipient":"unisex_adults","occasion":"wedding","style":null,"non_taxable":true,"is_customizable":false,"is_digital":false,"file_data":"","language":"en-US","has_variations":false,"suggested_taxonomy_id":1633,"taxonomy_path":["Weddings"],"used_manufacturer":false,"Images":[{"listing_image_id":702337356,"hex_code":"565868","red":86,"green":88,"blue":104,"hue":233,"saturation":17,"brightness":40,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1420484589,"listing_id":217313015,"rank":1,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/051\/0\/5448035\/il_75x75.702337356_hy03.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/051\/0\/5448035\/il_170x135.702337356_hy03.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/051\/0\/5448035\/il_570xN.702337356_hy03.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/051\/0\/5448035\/il_fullxfull.702337356_hy03.jpg","full_height":1047,"full_width":1500},{"listing_image_id":702462477,"hex_code":"484B64","red":72,"green":75,"blue":100,"hue":234,"saturation":28,"brightness":39,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1420484589,"listing_id":217313015,"rank":2,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/051\/0\/5448035\/il_75x75.702462477_9v9s.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/051\/0\/5448035\/il_170x135.702462477_9v9s.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/051\/0\/5448035\/il_570xN.702462477_9v9s.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/051\/0\/5448035\/il_fullxfull.702462477_9v9s.jpg","full_height":1500,"full_width":1048},{"listing_image_id":309283466,"hex_code":"D31527","red":211,"green":21,"blue":39,"hue":354,"saturation":89,"brightness":82,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1420484589,"listing_id":217313015,"rank":3,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/000\/0\/5448035\/il_75x75.309283466.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/000\/0\/5448035\/il_170x135.309283466.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/000\/0\/5448035\/il_570xN.309283466.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/000\/0\/5448035\/il_fullxfull.309283466.jpg","full_height":419,"full_width":363}],"Shop":{"shop_id":5448035,"shop_name":"FlasksPlus","user_id":6776398,"creation_tsz":1231893361,"title":"www.FlasksPlus.com","announcement":"Welcome to the Combined Web store for Flasks Plus and Chain Reactions.  Both web addresses will bring you to this same location.  The top few pages of this site are devoted to products promoted and sold by Chain Reactions, while the remaining pages display and sell products produced by Flasks Plus.\r\n\r\nI own and run the Flasks Plus side of things, while my wife, Janeen, runs Chain Reactions. We attempted to open and run a second Etsy store for my wife, but she admittedly was not very good or quick about responding to emails, orders, etc.  I&#39;ve been selling online since 1998, and here on Etsy for about a decade.  So, it made sense for us to combine our two sites, where I can monitor the sales and inquiries from both sides.  That allows my wife to do what she does best:  Measure, cut and bind necklace chain.\r\n\r\nFor those of you who have shopped Flasks Plus for years, one significant change is that we are no longer offering lasering on our flask products.  We ran into too many expensive issues with our laser machine, so we just shut it down, at least for now.  In the meantime, I simply combined a few of the flask option pages, to make room for us to add a few pages where we can promote my wife&#39;s chain and pendant options.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF CHAIN REACTIONS:\r\n\r\nThis is a very unique business my wife runs, started in Tennessee in 2000 by my father.  He got her started with it about 2 years ago, where we started setting up at various area craft shows since then.  Beginning in late December of 2014, we added her line of products here in this Etsy store, normally dominated by products created and promoted by Flasks Plus.\r\n\r\nHer primary product lines are pure 100% surgical stainless steel necklace chain options, half of which are also plated with 18k gold.  These chain options come rolled up on spools with several yards of chain on each one.  My wife cuts your chain by the exact inches measurement you purchase\/request.  She then cuts and binds your chain, before slipping them in a protective plastic baggie for mailing!  She also mounts pendants on your chain for you, if you also purchase pendants from her at the same time.\r\n\r\nHer secondary product lines are necklace pendant options, which she discounts along side purchases of 20 inches or more of her chain.  To receive those discounts, the pendant(s) must be purchased on the same date as the chain.\r\n\r\nFeel free to combine your purchases between both stores located here on the same site.\r\n\r\n**************************************************************************************\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF FLASKS PLUS:\r\n\r\nBasically, I create color coated stainless steel flask products, offered in up to 7 different sizes.  They can be used as wedding party gifts, or gifts for birthdays, graduations, or &quot;just because,&quot; while matching specific color themes.\r\n\r\nI offer in-country customers FREE shipping upgrades with the purchase of more than one regular priced flask, and include a FREE flask funnel with over 99% of what I sell here.  See the flask listings for more details on both offers.\r\n\r\nAs usual, you can order from any of our other flask listings, and request the specific color of your flask(s).  As long as you close on the right flask size, you can ask for any of the colors we list in ALL of our flask listings.  \r\n\r\nRELATED NOTE:  You can change the color of ANY of our regular priced flask products!!  Our full color lists (Metallic and Non-Metallic options) are now posted in all of our flask listings, for your convenience.\r\n\r\nAlso, feel free to ask for upgrades such as:\r\n**RUSH Service.............$2.00 per flask - Order is moved to the front of the ling.\r\n**Priority Mail.................Cost varies, depending on flask size, but comes free for in-country orders of 2 or more flask-funnel sets.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE:  In-country orders of more than one flask-funnel purchase receive a Priority Mail shipping upgrade, FREE of charge as well!  \r\n\r\nIn-Country Priority Mail Shipping = $4.50 for 18-oz flasks or smaller!\r\n(FREE when purchasing more than one flask at the same time.\r\n\r\n*****************************************************************\r\n                              For Buyers Local to us in Greeley, Colorado:  \r\n\r\nIf you&#39;re in a position to pick up your purchases when completed, we&#39;ll offer discounts off every flask purchase you want to make through our store.  Just let us know how many you want, what size flasks you want, and the color(s) you want them made in.  We&#39;ll set up a personal listing for you to close on.  Again, this offer is for local pickup orders only!  \r\n\r\n*****************************************************************\r\n\r\nThanks again, and have a SUPER DAY!\r\n\r\nYOUR Flask Is OUR Task!","currency_code":"USD","is_vacation":false,"vacation_message":null,"sale_message":"Thanks again for your support!  We no longer offer custom lasering services for any of our products at this time.

We may bring that service back again in the future.\r\n\r\nFor now, though, we&#39;ve reduced the prices of all of our flask products, to accommodate the lack of lasering services at this time.  However, we make a helpful suggestion in all of our listings regarding where else you can take your color flasks to have them custom laser etched.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIf you&#39;re in a hurry, please request either an upgrade in our shipping services (costs vary based on order size, weight and destination), or our famous RUSH Service ($2.00 per flask-funnel Set).\r\n\r\nAlso, in-country orders of 2 or more flask-funnel sets automatically receive a FREE Priority Mail shipping upgrade. \r\n\r\nThanks again, take care, and enjoy your new toy(s)!","digital_sale_message":null,"last_updated_tsz":1457553808,"listing_active_count":300,"digital_listing_count":0,"login_name":"FlasksPlus","accepts_custom_requests":true,"policy_welcome":"Welcome to our shop here on Etsy! We are VERY disgruntled (upset) former EBay Power Sellers, who grew EXTREMELY weery of their escalating auction pricing structure and rules.  THEIR rising auction fees caused US to raise the prices on what we sold, which thus financially squeezed our customers excessively!  I am a full time Marketing Education teacher at a local high school, and my wife supports what I do with my spare time business.\r\n\r\nDue to EBay&#39;s growing GREED explained above, my wife and I have broken away from EBay for the most part, and have started up two separate web sites, as well as this shop here on Etsy.  Eventually, all 3 locations will be fully stocked with our regular merchandise, as well as that which we wish to clear out of our inventory.  In the meantime, feel free to shop any or all three locations, and purchase or inquire about what you would like.  We can help arrange safe and secure payments for it all.  \r\n\r\nWhat will eventually become our BASE web site is:\r\nwww.FlasksPlus.com.  At the present time, we don&#39;t have the PayPal shopping carts in place, but they should be there shortly.  We&#39;re also adding more merchandise as we find the time to do so.  \r\n\r\nOur secondary web site is one where we&#39;re using a LIVE chat room as a draw to it.  We don&#39;t have a more personalized domain name (web address) for it yet, but we&#39;ll relay it to all of our customers as soon as we DO.  For now, here is the link that will take you there:\r\nhttp:\/\/robertorrjr.tripod.com\/freechat\/\r\nWe have a growing list of nice gift ideas posted on THAT site, all of which can be used for special ocasions, such as wedding party gifts, graduations, birthdays, holidays, and more.  Most of the merchandise showing on that site location can be customized, either through embroidery, laser engraving, etc.\r\n\r\nAs is the case with all three of our locations, feel free to email us directly, when you have any questions, comments or concerns!  We are here to help you get what you need!  You may email us directly at:  RobOrrJr2@aol.com","policy_payment":"We tend to be VERY flexible, in terms of our payment policies. We accept PayPal, money order, personal check, and well-concealed cash payments, listed in the order of the most secure options.  \r\n\r\nPayPal is the most secure form of payment, and we can either accept your detailed payment invoices sent by you through YOUR PayPal account to our email address (RobOrrJr2@aol.com), or WE can create and send a secure itemized invoice through OUR account to your email address.  Either way works fine.  Using PayPal allows us to ship your goods immediately with our next USPS package pickup, unless there is custom work being requested.   \r\n\r\nIf PayPal is used, please be sure to use your &quot;Confirmed&quot; mailing address on file with PayPal as your shipping address when you submit your payment.  If your address comes through marked as, &quot;Unconfirmed,&quot; then we will not be able to ship your goods. PayPal&#39;s seller protection policy forbids us from shipping to addresses that PayPal does NOT already have on file with our shoppers.  Contact us for more information.\r\n\r\nSending money orders is almost as secure as doing so through PayPal. Since money orders is like cash, we can ship your goods as quickly as we do for those who use PayPal.\r\n\r\nSending personal checks is fine as well.  However, please realize that we DO hold onto personal checks deposited in OUR bank account for up to 7 business days, to ensure the clearance of your funds, before we can ship your purchase(s).\r\n\r\nSending well-concealed cash is also fine, but not recommended.  Every now and then we sell smaller items where customers prefer to slip smaller amounts of money in envelopes, and not worry about writing checks, paying for money orders, etc.  IF you do this, please make sure that this cash is VERY well wrapped up inside your envelope, and not visible outside of it.  Also, know that we are NOT responsible for such payments being lost, stolen, etc. in transit.","policy_shipping":"For more than 95% of what we ship, we utilize the United States Postal Service (USPS).  The two primary options people have for in-country packages are &quot;Parcel Post&quot; and &quot;Priority Mail.&quot;  Parcel Post is cheaper, but takes longer than Priority Mail in most cases.  Priority Mail comes with a 2-3 days in-transit guarantee from USPS, meaning your packages should arrive in within 1-3 days from the day we ship them.\r\n\r\nOUR shipping routine tends to be on a rotating every-2-days basis.  When our next shipping day falls on a weekend or holiday, we still get our packages shipped, but we do so through a new automated postal center, located within one of our local USPS depots.  These are self-serving machines that allow us to ENSURE that our packages are always shipped on our every 2 days rotation for you.\r\n\r\nFeel free to email us about our next shipping date, before you purchase anything (RobOrrJr2@aol.com).","policy_refunds":"Under some circumstances, we&#39;ll allow for a full and unconditional refund of your items.  In other cases, we&#39;ll offer exchanges, and reimbursements for return shipping costs.  Further, in still more situations, we will offer partial refunds as well.\r\n\r\nFull and Unconditional refunds will be offered in situations where (A) we&#39;ve either sent the wrong merchandise altogether, and\/or (B) when we&#39;ve shipped something that ended up having factory related damages or defects.  We will work out THOSE details with customers on a 1-on-1 basis, as those cases arise.  In most instances where a full refund is sought, we&#39;ll simply ask you to tape up your packages neatly, include a brief now explaining the issue, circle our mailing address, mark it clearly as, &quot;Return To Sender&quot; and drop it in any USPS mail bin.   \r\n\r\nExchanges can happen for a wide variety of reasons, where the customer(s) involved wish to have the merchandise they ordered, but simply want it traded out, etc.  In cases where it&#39;s due to factory defects or damages, we&#39;ll also reimburse customers for their shipping costs to return the originally sent items. Customers in THIS situation MUST contact us prior to returning such items, so that they can receive proper return shipping instructions.\r\n\r\nFinally, in cases where customers simply change their minds about something, we are willing to take the goods back, but will issue a partial refund upon the return of the items involved, and once we inspect them for new condition, etc.  We will deduct the actual shipping costs we paid to send the item(s) to you originally, and issue your refund of the balance.  We simply cannot afford to pay 2-way shipping costs for something we shipped as pictured, described, and promised, when people change their minds.  A good way to think about this is to ask yourself if a company such as Wal Mart pays its refunding customers the gas money it took to drive to the store and back.","policy_additional":"Approximately 99% of the merchandise we sell through Etsy, and our two new and developing off-EBay web sites is BRAND new, and normally come with their original tags, boxes, and even UPC labels.  Whenever we sell used and\/or reconditioned items, we&#39;ll clearly state that within the written descriptions of our things.\r\n\r\nOur two base web addresses again are:\r\nwww.FlasksPlus.com\r\nand\r\nhttp:\/\/robertorrjr.tripod.com\/freechat\/\r\nThe second one as a FREE live chat room on it as well.

If you DO request to have your flask customized, ask for more information either before you order, or in the comments box after you order!\n\nSAME SIDE LASERING = It does not cost anything more if you ask for custom lasering to be added to just 1 side of this flask. We&#39;ll send you your font style options for lettering via email. Please know that adding custom lettering will delay the shipping date by 3-4 days. \n\nSECOND SIDE LASERING = If you ask for lasering on the other side, too, it costs just $3.00 more, which we can invoice you for through PayPal. Ask for that invoice when you place your order. We&#39;ll send you your font style options for lettering via email. Please know that adding custom lettering will delay the shipping date by 3-4 days. \n\nIf you want to add a flask funnel for just $3.00 more, let us know, and we&#39;ll invoice you for it, separately! THIS LISTING DOES NOT COME WITH A FLASK FUNNEL, AUTOMATICALLY!\n*********************************************************************************************\n\nIn an effort to offer streamlined and easy-to-order flask options, we&#39;ve set up listings like this one where ALL you have to do is purchase the number of them you want. There are no customizing options to consider, no additional questions to answer, NOTHING! We will ship your flask exactly as pictured, just as the title says.\n\nNOTE #1: We ship packages every 2 to 3 days depending on how many need to go out, and when USPS can swing by for a pickup. Please keep that in mind when it comes to how long it will take to arrive.\n\nNOTE #2: In-country customers can expect the arrival of their packages within 4-6 days from the date we ship them, if they stay with the FREE method of shipping. There also are no tracking numbers that go with this FREE shipping option. If you want to upgrade to Priority Mail, you can request that in the Comments box, and we&#39;ll invoice you for the $4.50 needed to do so.\n\nNOTE #3: In-country customers who order more than one of these flasks at the same time, will receive that Priority Mail shipping upgrade, FREE of charge, and automatically! You don&#39;t have to ask for it.\n\n***********************************************************\nBARE-BONES BASIC DETAILS:\n\nThese nice flasks come all in ONE piece, with the permanently attached screw-top lid!  Just like with the leather-wrapped stainless steel flask style, we add at least 2 layers of your choice of color, before lasering work is completed on it.  This specific flask style will hold up to 6 ounces of your favorite Uncle&#39;s choice of adult &quot;sipping beverage.&quot; It stands approximately 4-1\/4&quot;  tall, is about 3-3\/4&quot; wide across the front, and just more than \u00be&quot; thick. \n\nIf you don&#39;t want or need anything more, you don&#39;t need to read further. Beyond this point, we just answer some frequently asked questions many of our customers ask.\n\n***********************************************************\n**WHAT DO I GET FOR THIS PRICE?\n\nHere is a list of everything you\u2019ll receive for the price shown:\n(only our outside-of-country customers pay additional shipping costs)\n\n1) A stainless steel flask shipped in the size outlined in the listing\u2019s title.\n2) The color and graphics shown in the picture(s) attached here.\n3) All in-country shipping and packaging. \u201cFirst Class\u201d through USPS is what this order comes with, FREE, for single-flask purchases for in-country customers. In-country customers also receive a FREE shipping upgrade to the swifter \u201cPriority Mail\u201d option when they order more than one flask-funnel set at the same time, to be shipped to the same address. To find out more about the \u201cOvernight Guaranteed\u201d shipping option and rates, read more under the heading, \u201cARE FASTER SHIPPING OPTIONS AVAILABLE?\u201d below. \n\n\n**WHAT DISCOUNTS ARE OFFERED FOR QUANTITY PURCHASES?\n\nOur in-country customers receive an automatic and FREE shipping upgrade to the swifter \u201cPriority Mail\u201d shipping option when they order more than 1 flask per purchase, as long as all flasks are shipped to the same address.\n\nPlease contact us for pricing on larger bulk flask orders, but know that due to our very low retail pricing structure, there isn&#39;t a lot of room for additional discounting.\n\n**WHAT COLOR(S) WILL THIS FLASK BE MADE IN?\n\nBy default, unless you specify otherwise, your flask(s) will be made in the color shown in the picture(s) attached with this listing. However, you do NOT have to stay with that color option. You can switch colors FREE OF CHARGE!! Check out: www.FlasksPlus1.com for all of your flask color options (click on the \u201cColor Options\u201d page link, once there).\n\n\n**WHAT FONT STYLE CHOICES DO I\/WE HAVE FOR LETTERING?\n\nYou will have well over 4,000 different font styles to choose from after you submit your order. There are far too many to list, here, but we\u2019ll give you the link to a web site that our laser communicates with after we receive your order and payment. There is everything from the plain and simple, to fairly fancy choices. There are also movie and cartoon character themed font styles, and more. We\u2019re POSITIVE you will find just the right style you want for your flask(s).\n\nNOTE: Once you place your order, we\u2019ll caution you against choosing a font style that is \u201ctoo fancy\u201d with finer detailing. We\u2019ve had some difficulties with a few of the REAL fine and fancy font styles from that site, but we\u2019ll help you get just the right one(s) for what you want to do with your flask(s).\n\n\n**CAN I\/WE ADD CUSTOM LASERING TO THE BACK SIDE, TOO?\n\nYes. For orders of 1 \u2013 5 flasks, the cost to add custom lasering to the back side is just $3.00 per flask. Once order hit the 6-flask or more levels, you receive back-side lasering FREE of charge. We will email you an invoice for this back-side custom lasering securely through PayPal upon request when you place your order.\n\n\n**HOW ARE THESE FLASKS LASERED (The process)?\n\nWe use our laser engraving machine to burn-cut through your color choice. For this style of flask, we also burn-cut into, but not all the way through the factory-applied permanent leather wrapping on them. However, we do NOT go all the way through to the stainless steel, with this flask. The results show a consistent and BEAUTIFUL \u201cetched\u201d Black look where the laser affects your flask(s).\n\n\n**HOW WILL MY ORDER SHIP (U.S. Addresses)?\n\nAll in-country orders ship via USPS. Single-flask in-country orders ship via \u201cFirst Class,\u201d while multiple flask orders shipped to U.S. addresses ship via the swifter \u201cPriority Mail\u201d option, FREE of charge. Read through the \u201cARE FASTER SHIPPING OPTIONS AVAILABLE?\u201d subheading, below, if you need your order shipped overnight.\n\n\n**HOW WILL MY ORDER SHIP (Outside-of-country addresses)?\n\nOutside-of country orders will all ship via \u201cFirst Class Air\u201d via USPS. To help these customers save money on their purchases, we ALWAYS clearly mark the customs paperwork as, \u201cGIFT\u201d prior to releasing them in the mail. This helps prevent our customers from being charged their local customs fees, too, when their packages arrive.\n\n\n\n**ARE FASTER SHIPPING OPTIONS AVAILABLE?\n\nYes, but for U.S.-bound addresses, only. \n\nPriority Mail = Single flask purchases by U.S. customers can upgrade to the swifter \u201cPriority Mail\u201d option for just $4.50 each for flasks that are 4-oz through 18-oz in size. It costs just $9.99 to upgrade a single-flask U.S.-bound purchase of our JUMBO 64-oz or 1-Gallon size flasks via Priority Mail. In these cases, we can email you a secure invoice through PayPal to your email address of choice upon request. U.S-bound orders of 2 or more flask-funnel sets are upgraded to this option FREE of charge, regardless of the expense to us.\n\nPriority Mail Exress (overnight) = This option starts at $22.00, and is based on the size of your total order. Feel free to email us for a quote based on the number and size of flask(s) you\u2019re wanting.\n\n\n\n\n**HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE TO CREATE MY\/OUR ORDER?\n\nNormal production times for personalized orders run from 3 to 5 days, depending on the number of total flasks you\u2019re ordering, and the complexity (difficulty) of what you\u2019re asking to be done. Busier times of the year, such as Thanksgiving thru Christmas can see somewhat longer production wait times.\n\nYour product wait time includes waiting for your choice of color to fully dry, as well as the time it takes the clearcoat sealer applied after the lasering to dry. In both cases, that\u2019s about a full day. The time needed to set up the laser template and laser your flask(s) doesn\u2019t take all that long, and much of that time is saved because we set everything up while your flask(s) is\/are drying for color. From there, it just depend on how many other orders are in ahead of yours.\n\n\n**CAN I ASK THAT MY ORDER BE \u201cRUSHED?\u201d\n\nYes. For just $2.00 per flask, for a maximum of $10.00 per order, we will move your order to the front of the line for you. That will shave anywhere from 2-4 days of production wait time off getting your order completed and shipped. Orders of 6 or more flask-funnel sets get this \u201cRUSH Service\u201d free of charge.\n\n\n**HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE TO ARRIVE AFTER MY\/OUR PACKAGE SHIPS?\n\nU.S. Customers = \u201cFirst Class\u201d through USPS takes anywhere from 4-6 days to arrive from when shipped. \u201cPriority Mail\u201d takes from 2-4 days from when shipped. \u201cPriority Mail Express\u201d gets there overnight from when shipped, as long as your package ships by 3pm local time. These are all estimated in-transit mail times that your package will spend in the mail system after we get them to USPS.\n\n\n**CAN I TRACK MY PACKAGE?\n\nYes, for U.S.-bound addresses only, as long as your package ships via either \u201cPriority Mail\u201d or \u201cPriority Mail Express (overnight).\u201d \u201cFirst Class\u201d does not come with tracking services automatically. If you\u2019re ordering a single flask-funnel set and staying with the FREE \u201cFirst Class\u201d shipping option, then you\u2019ll need to request that we add tracking services for $1.50 more per package. We can invoice you for that charge securely through PayPal.\n\nAlso, we are not set up with an automated tracking number reporting service at this time. This means that we\u2019ll need to send your tracking numbers to you via manually-created and sent email. If you want your tracking numbers, please email us on or about the day we estimate your package will ship for you.\n\n\nThanks again for shopping here in our Etsy store, and we look VERY forward to helping create just the right flask order for you!","creation_tsz":1457553783,"ending_tsz":1468090983,"original_creation_tsz":1257651998,"last_modified_tsz":1457553783,"price":"6.99","currency_code":"USD","quantity":494,"tags":["wedding party gift","graduation gift","flask","flasks","whiskey","Laser Engraved"],"category_path":["Weddings"],"category_path_ids":[68887494],"materials":["stainless steel","metallic cherry red color finish"],"shop_section_id":6545614,"featured_rank":null,"state_tsz":1455503442,"url":"https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/listing\/34040639\/as-shown-6-oz-metallic-cherry-red?utm_source=theironyardteaching&utm_medium=api&utm_campaign=api","views":532,"num_favorers":8,"shipping_template_id":null,"processing_min":3,"processing_max":5,"who_made":"i_did","is_supply":"false","when_made":"2010_2016","item_weight":null,"item_weight_units":null,"item_length":null,"item_width":null,"item_height":null,"item_dimensions_unit":"in","is_private":false,"recipient":"unisex_adults","occasion":"wedding","style":null,"non_taxable":true,"is_customizable":true,"is_digital":false,"file_data":"","language":"en-US","has_variations":false,"taxonomy_id":1633,"taxonomy_path":["Weddings"],"used_manufacturer":false,"Images":[{"listing_image_id":100913329,"hex_code":"838689","red":131,"green":134,"blue":137,"hue":210,"saturation":4,"brightness":53,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1299877281,"listing_id":34040639,"rank":1,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/000\/0\/5448035\/il_75x75.100913329.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/000\/0\/5448035\/il_170x135.100913329.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/000\/0\/5448035\/il_570xN.100913329.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/000\/0\/5448035\/il_fullxfull.100913329.jpg","full_height":500,"full_width":346}],"Shop":{"shop_id":5448035,"shop_name":"FlasksPlus","user_id":6776398,"creation_tsz":1231893361,"title":"www.FlasksPlus.com","announcement":"Welcome to the Combined Web store for Flasks Plus and Chain Reactions.  Both web addresses will bring you to this same location.  The top few pages of this site are devoted to products promoted and sold by Chain Reactions, while the remaining pages display and sell products produced by Flasks Plus.\r\n\r\nI own and run the Flasks Plus side of things, while my wife, Janeen, runs Chain Reactions. We attempted to open and run a second Etsy store for my wife, but she admittedly was not very good or quick about responding to emails, orders, etc.  I&#39;ve been selling online since 1998, and here on Etsy for about a decade.  So, it made sense for us to combine our two sites, where I can monitor the sales and inquiries from both sides.  That allows my wife to do what she does best:  Measure, cut and bind necklace chain.\r\n\r\nFor those of you who have shopped Flasks Plus for years, one significant change is that we are no longer offering lasering on our flask products.  We ran into too many expensive issues with our laser machine, so we just shut it down, at least for now.  In the meantime, I simply combined a few of the flask option pages, to make room for us to add a few pages where we can promote my wife&#39;s chain and pendant options.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF CHAIN REACTIONS:\r\n\r\nThis is a very unique business my wife runs, started in Tennessee in 2000 by my father.  He got her started with it about 2 years ago, where we started setting up at various area craft shows since then.  Beginning in late December of 2014, we added her line of products here in this Etsy store, normally dominated by products created and promoted by Flasks Plus.\r\n\r\nHer primary product lines are pure 100% surgical stainless steel necklace chain options, half of which are also plated with 18k gold.  These chain options come rolled up on spools with several yards of chain on each one.  My wife cuts your chain by the exact inches measurement you purchase\/request.  She then cuts and binds your chain, before slipping them in a protective plastic baggie for mailing!  She also mounts pendants on your chain for you, if you also purchase pendants from her at the same time.\r\n\r\nHer secondary product lines are necklace pendant options, which she discounts along side purchases of 20 inches or more of her chain.  To receive those discounts, the pendant(s) must be purchased on the same date as the chain.\r\n\r\nFeel free to combine your purchases between both stores located here on the same site.\r\n\r\n**************************************************************************************\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF FLASKS PLUS:\r\n\r\nBasically, I create color coated stainless steel flask products, offered in up to 7 different sizes.  They can be used as wedding party gifts, or gifts for birthdays, graduations, or &quot;just because,&quot; while matching specific color themes.\r\n\r\nI offer in-country customers FREE shipping upgrades with the purchase of more than one regular priced flask, and include a FREE flask funnel with over 99% of what I sell here.  See the flask listings for more details on both offers.\r\n\r\nAs usual, you can order from any of our other flask listings, and request the specific color of your flask(s).  As long as you close on the right flask size, you can ask for any of the colors we list in ALL of our flask listings.  \r\n\r\nRELATED NOTE:  You can change the color of ANY of our regular priced flask products!!  Our full color lists (Metallic and Non-Metallic options) are now posted in all of our flask listings, for your convenience.\r\n\r\nAlso, feel free to ask for upgrades such as:\r\n**RUSH Service.............$2.00 per flask - Order is moved to the front of the ling.\r\n**Priority Mail.................Cost varies, depending on flask size, but comes free for in-country orders of 2 or more flask-funnel sets.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE:  In-country orders of more than one flask-funnel purchase receive a Priority Mail shipping upgrade, FREE of charge as well!  \r\n\r\nIn-Country Priority Mail Shipping = $4.50 for 18-oz flasks or smaller!\r\n(FREE when purchasing more than one flask at the same time.\r\n\r\n*****************************************************************\r\n                              For Buyers Local to us in Greeley, Colorado:  \r\n\r\nIf you&#39;re in a position to pick up your purchases when completed, we&#39;ll offer discounts off every flask purchase you want to make through our store.  Just let us know how many you want, what size flasks you want, and the color(s) you want them made in.  We&#39;ll set up a personal listing for you to close on.  Again, this offer is for local pickup orders only!  \r\n\r\n*****************************************************************\r\n\r\nThanks again, and have a SUPER DAY!\r\n\r\nYOUR Flask Is OUR Task!","currency_code":"USD","is_vacation":false,"vacation_message":null,"sale_message":"Thanks again for your support!

We may bring that service back again in the future.\r\n\r\nFor now, though, we&#39;ve reduced the prices of all of our flask products, to accommodate the lack of lasering services at this time.  However, we make a helpful suggestion in all of our listings regarding where else you can take your color flasks to have them custom laser etched.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIf you&#39;re in a hurry, please request either an upgrade in our shipping services (costs vary based on order size, weight and destination), or our famous RUSH Service ($2.00 per flask-funnel Set).\r\n\r\nAlso, in-country orders of 2 or more flask-funnel sets automatically receive a FREE Priority Mail shipping upgrade. \r\n\r\nThanks again, take care, and enjoy your new toy(s)!","digital_sale_message":null,"last_updated_tsz":1457553808,"listing_active_count":300,"digital_listing_count":0,"login_name":"FlasksPlus","accepts_custom_requests":true,"policy_welcome":"Welcome to our shop here on Etsy! We are VERY disgruntled (upset) former EBay Power Sellers, who grew EXTREMELY weery of their escalating auction pricing structure and rules.  THEIR rising auction fees caused US to raise the prices on what we sold, which thus financially squeezed our customers excessively!  I am a full time Marketing Education teacher at a local high school, and my wife supports what I do with my spare time business.\r\n\r\nDue to EBay&#39;s growing GREED explained above, my wife and I have broken away from EBay for the most part, and have started up two separate web sites, as well as this shop here on Etsy.  Eventually, all 3 locations will be fully stocked with our regular merchandise, as well as that which we wish to clear out of our inventory.  In the meantime, feel free to shop any or all three locations, and purchase or inquire about what you would like.  We can help arrange safe and secure payments for it all.  \r\n\r\nWhat will eventually become our BASE web site is:\r\nwww.FlasksPlus.com.  At the present time, we don&#39;t have the PayPal shopping carts in place, but they should be there shortly.  We&#39;re also adding more merchandise as we find the time to do so.  \r\n\r\nOur secondary web site is one where we&#39;re using a LIVE chat room as a draw to it.  We don&#39;t have a more personalized domain name (web address) for it yet, but we&#39;ll relay it to all of our customers as soon as we DO.  For now, here is the link that will take you there:\r\nhttp:\/\/robertorrjr.tripod.com\/freechat\/\r\nWe have a growing list of nice gift ideas posted on THAT site, all of which can be used for special ocasions, such as wedding party gifts, graduations, birthdays, holidays, and more.  Most of the merchandise showing on that site location can be customized, either through embroidery, laser engraving, etc.\r\n\r\nAs is the case with all three of our locations, feel free to email us directly, when you have any questions, comments or concerns!  We are here to help you get what you need!  You may email us directly at:  RobOrrJr2@aol.com","policy_payment":"We tend to be VERY flexible, in terms of our payment policies. We accept PayPal, money order, personal check, and well-concealed cash payments, listed in the order of the most secure options.  \r\n\r\nPayPal is the most secure form of payment, and we can either accept your detailed payment invoices sent by you through YOUR PayPal account to our email address (RobOrrJr2@aol.com), or WE can create and send a secure itemized invoice through OUR account to your email address.  Either way works fine.  Using PayPal allows us to ship your goods immediately with our next USPS package pickup, unless there is custom work being requested.   \r\n\r\nIf PayPal is used, please be sure to use your &quot;Confirmed&quot; mailing address on file with PayPal as your shipping address when you submit your payment.  If your address comes through marked as, &quot;Unconfirmed,&quot; then we will not be able to ship your goods. PayPal&#39;s seller protection policy forbids us from shipping to addresses that PayPal does NOT already have on file with our shoppers.  Contact us for more information.\r\n\r\nSending money orders is almost as secure as doing so through PayPal. Since money orders is like cash, we can ship your goods as quickly as we do for those who use PayPal.\r\n\r\nSending personal checks is fine as well.  However, please realize that we DO hold onto personal checks deposited in OUR bank account for up to 7 business days, to ensure the clearance of your funds, before we can ship your purchase(s).\r\n\r\nSending well-concealed cash is also fine, but not recommended.  Every now and then we sell smaller items where customers prefer to slip smaller amounts of money in envelopes, and not worry about writing checks, paying for money orders, etc.  IF you do this, please make sure that this cash is VERY well wrapped up inside your envelope, and not visible outside of it.  Also, know that we are NOT responsible for such payments being lost, stolen, etc. in transit.","policy_shipping":"For more than 95% of what we ship, we utilize the United States Postal Service (USPS).  The two primary options people have for in-country packages are &quot;Parcel Post&quot; and &quot;Priority Mail.&quot;  Parcel Post is cheaper, but takes longer than Priority Mail in most cases.  Priority Mail comes with a 2-3 days in-transit guarantee from USPS, meaning your packages should arrive in within 1-3 days from the day we ship them.\r\n\r\nOUR shipping routine tends to be on a rotating every-2-days basis.  When our next shipping day falls on a weekend or holiday, we still get our packages shipped, but we do so through a new automated postal center, located within one of our local USPS depots.  These are self-serving machines that allow us to ENSURE that our packages are always shipped on our every 2 days rotation for you.\r\n\r\nFeel free to email us about our next shipping date, before you purchase anything (RobOrrJr2@aol.com).","policy_refunds":"Under some circumstances, we&#39;ll allow for a full and unconditional refund of your items.  In other cases, we&#39;ll offer exchanges, and reimbursements for return shipping costs.  Further, in still more situations, we will offer partial refunds as well.\r\n\r\nFull and Unconditional refunds will be offered in situations where (A) we&#39;ve either sent the wrong merchandise altogether, and\/or (B) when we&#39;ve shipped something that ended up having factory related damages or defects.  We will work out THOSE details with customers on a 1-on-1 basis, as those cases arise.  In most instances where a full refund is sought, we&#39;ll simply ask you to tape up your packages neatly, include a brief now explaining the issue, circle our mailing address, mark it clearly as, &quot;Return To Sender&quot; and drop it in any USPS mail bin.   \r\n\r\nExchanges can happen for a wide variety of reasons, where the customer(s) involved wish to have the merchandise they ordered, but simply want it traded out, etc.  In cases where it&#39;s due to factory defects or damages, we&#39;ll also reimburse customers for their shipping costs to return the originally sent items. Customers in THIS situation MUST contact us prior to returning such items, so that they can receive proper return shipping instructions.\r\n\r\nFinally, in cases where customers simply change their minds about something, we are willing to take the goods back, but will issue a partial refund upon the return of the items involved, and once we inspect them for new condition, etc.  We will deduct the actual shipping costs we paid to send the item(s) to you originally, and issue your refund of the balance.  We simply cannot afford to pay 2-way shipping costs for something we shipped as pictured, described, and promised, when people change their minds.  A good way to think about this is to ask yourself if a company such as Wal Mart pays its refunding customers the gas money it took to drive to the store and back.","policy_additional":"Approximately 99% of the merchandise we sell through Etsy, and our two new and developing off-EBay web sites is BRAND new, and normally come with their original tags, boxes, and even UPC labels.  Whenever we sell used and\/or reconditioned items, we&#39;ll clearly state that within the written descriptions of our things.\r\n\r\nOur two base web addresses again are:\r\nwww.FlasksPlus.com\r\nand\r\nhttp:\/\/robertorrjr.tripod.com\/freechat\/\r\nThe second one as a FREE live chat room on it as well.

If you would like a color flask with custom lasering and a FREE flask funnel, check out ANY of our 8-oz flask listings that promote lasering and funnels in their titles.\r\n\r\n\r\nSimply confirm the color you want your flask-only to be made in, and you can do this using the &quot;Comment&quot; box on your order form.\r\n\r\nThere is only room to show you just 5 of our different color options actually on flasks (see images above).  However, we&#39;ve posted our full lists of color choices below.  You can also see ALL of our colors on flasks on our information-only web site, at:\r\n\r\nwww.FlasksPlus1.com  - - Once there, click on the &quot;Color Options&quot; page link, and then scroll down a little.  There will be a link to take you to seeing flasks made in every single one of our color options.\r\n\r\nYou need to make your purchases here, but that web site gives you a lot more in-depth information about all of your options, so we can keep these listings shorter.\r\n\r\n \r\n                                                 FLASK DESCRIPTION (8-oz Option):  \r\n\r\nThis specific flask size will hold up to 8 ounces of your favorite Uncle&#39;s choice of adult &quot;sipping beverage.&quot;  Both style options stand approximately 6&quot; tall, is about 3-3\/4&quot; wide across the front, and just more than \u00be&quot; thick. These nice flasks come all in ONE piece, with the permanently attached screw-top lid!  \r\n\r\nWhen you submit your order through this listing, all you should let us know to save time are the following:  A)  What flask style you do want, and B)  What color do you want your flask(s) to be made in?  Both options are explained below.\r\n\r\n                                                       FLASK STYLE OPTIONS:\r\n\r\n1)  Plain Stainless Steel = With this one, the full flask is completely made of stainless steel, plus your color choice.\r\n\r\n2)  Stainless Steel Plus Permanent Leather-Wrap =  This style is the nicest of the two styles, but doesn&#39;t cost anything more.  The flask itself is completely made of stainless steel, but it also comes with factory-applied permanent leather wrap on them.  We then just add your color choice.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                   FLASK COLOR OPTIONS:\r\n\r\nMetallic Color Options:\r\n\r\n**Metallic Black\r\n**Moonlight Metallic Black (it has gold and silver crystals in it.)\r\n**Metallic Gold\r\n**Metallic Copper (appears like a brighter Metallic Gold)\r\n**Metallic Dark Gold\r\n**Metallic (Dark) Purple\r\n**Metallic (Dark) Blue\r\n**Metallic Silver\r\n**Metallic Cherry Red\r\n**Metallic Dark Green\r\n**Metallic Light Green\r\n**Metallic Textured Sea Green\r\n**Metallic Textured Brown (darker brown)\r\n**Metallic Hammored Copper\r\n**Metallic Hammored Silver\r\n**Metallic Hammored Deep Green\r\n**Metallic Hammored Gold (lighter gold)\r\n**Metallic Hammored Gloss Dark Brown\r\n**Metallic Hammored Gloss Black\r\n**Textured Sandstone Camo\r\n**(more Metallic Color Options Will Be Added Soon)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNon-Metallic Color Options:\r\n\r\n\r\n**Primer-Like Gray\r\n**Gloss Black\r\n**Leather Brown\r\n**Grey\r\n**Forest Green\r\n**Bright Green\r\n**Fire Red\r\n**Dark Purple\r\n**Light Purple\r\n**Dark Blue\r\n**Light Blue\r\n**Satin Pink\r\n**HOT (Bright) Pink\r\n**Yellow\r\n**Bright (Florescent) Orange\r\n**Pumpkin Orange\r\n\r\n**HOT (Bright) Pink\r\n**Satin Pink\r\n**HOT (Bright) Pink\r\n**Bright (Florescent) Orange\r\n**Pumpkin Orange\r\n**Satin Pink\r\n\r\nIf you don&#39;t see a favorite color listed here, feel free to email us with your request (mailto:RobOrrJr2@aol.com), and we&#39;ll look into it for you as quickly as we can.\r\n\r\n\r\nSHIPPING INFORMATION =\r\nAll U.S.-bound single flask orders ship via &quot;First Class&quot; through USPS, FREE of charge.  When 2 or more flasks are purchased for U.S.-bound addresses, we offer a FREE shipping upgrade to the swifter Priority Mail option.  This is done automatically, and without a request or reminder necessary.  Further, U.S.-bound Priority Mail orders also receive FREE tracking services as well.\r\n\r\nOut-of-country orders all ship via &quot;First Class Air&quot; via USPS.  Unfortunately, due to a recent and significant rate hike by USPS, we had to move our shipping charges upward, considerably.  That was not done by our choice.  We had to match what USPS did with their rate charts.  HOWEVER, we always and CLEARLY mark all customs paperwork as &quot;GIFT,&quot; so this will help our foreign customers avoid paying their local customs fees upon the arrival of your package.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions that we didn&#39;t provide the answers for here, feel free to send us a message through the Etsy system, or you can email us directly at:\r\n\r\nRobOrrJ2@aol.com\r\n\r\nThanks again for shopping here in our Etsy store, and we look VERY forward to helping create just the right flask order for you!","creation_tsz":1457553675,"ending_tsz":1468090875,"original_creation_tsz":1368495290,"last_modified_tsz":1457553675,"price":"8.99","currency_code":"USD","quantity":500,"tags":["bar

to the Combined Web store for Flasks Plus and Chain Reactions.  Both web addresses will bring you to this same location.  The top few pages of this site are devoted to products promoted and sold by Chain Reactions, while the remaining pages display and sell products produced by Flasks Plus.\r\n\r\nI own and run the Flasks Plus side of things, while my wife, Janeen, runs Chain Reactions. We attempted to open and run a second Etsy store for my wife, but she admittedly was not very good or quick about responding to emails, orders, etc.  I&#39;ve been selling online since 1998, and here on Etsy for about a decade.  So, it made sense for us to combine our two sites, where I can monitor the sales and inquiries from both sides.  That allows my wife to do what she does best:  Measure, cut and bind necklace chain.\r\n\r\nFor those of you who have shopped Flasks Plus for years, one significant change is that we are no longer offering lasering on our flask products.  We ran into too many expensive issues with our laser machine, so we just shut it down, at least for now.  In the meantime, I simply combined a few of the flask option pages, to make room for us to add a few pages where we can promote my wife&#39;s chain and pendant options.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF CHAIN REACTIONS:\r\n\r\nThis is a very unique business my wife runs, started in Tennessee in 2000 by my father.  He got her started with it about 2 years ago, where we started setting up at various area craft shows since then.  Beginning in late December of 2014, we added her line of products here in this Etsy store, normally dominated by products created and promoted by Flasks Plus.\r\n\r\nHer primary product lines are pure 100% surgical stainless steel necklace chain options, half of which are also plated with 18k gold.  These chain options come rolled up on spools with several yards of chain on each one.  My wife cuts your chain by the exact inches measurement you purchase\/request.  She then cuts and binds your chain, before slipping them in a protective plastic baggie for mailing!  She also mounts pendants on your chain for you, if you also purchase pendants from her at the same time.\r\n\r\nHer secondary product lines are necklace pendant options, which she discounts along side purchases of 20 inches or more of her chain.  To receive those discounts, the pendant(s) must be purchased on the same date as the chain.\r\n\r\nFeel free to combine your purchases between both stores located here on the same site.\r\n\r\n**************************************************************************************\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF FLASKS PLUS:\r\n\r\nBasically, I create color coated stainless steel flask products, offered in up to 7 different sizes.  They can be used as wedding party gifts, or gifts for birthdays, graduations, or &quot;just because,&quot; while matching specific color themes.\r\n\r\nI offer in-country customers FREE shipping upgrades with the purchase of more than one regular priced flask, and include a FREE flask funnel with over 99% of what I sell here.  See the flask listings for more details on both offers.\r\n\r\nAs usual, you can order from any of our other flask listings, and request the specific color of your flask(s).  As long as you close on the right flask size, you can ask for any of the colors we list in ALL of our flask listings.  \r\n\r\nRELATED NOTE:  You can change the color of ANY of our regular priced flask products!!  Our full color lists (Metallic and Non-Metallic options) are now posted in all of our flask listings, for your convenience.\r\n\r\nAlso, feel free to ask for upgrades such as:\r\n**RUSH Service.............$2.00 per flask - Order is moved to the front of the ling.\r\n**Priority Mail.................Cost varies, depending on flask size, but comes free for in-country orders of 2 or more flask-funnel sets.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE:  In-country orders of more than one flask-funnel purchase receive a Priority Mail shipping upgrade, FREE of charge as well!  \r\n\r\nIn-Country Priority Mail Shipping = $4.50 for 18-oz flasks or smaller!\r\n(FREE when purchasing more than one flask at the same time.\r\n\r\n*****************************************************************\r\n                              For Buyers Local to us in Greeley, Colorado:  \r\n\r\nIf you&#39;re in a position to pick up your purchases when completed, we&#39;ll offer discounts off every flask purchase you want to make through our store.  Just let us know how many you want, what size flasks you want, and the color(s) you want them made in.  We&#39;ll set up a personal listing for you to close on.  Again, this offer is for local pickup orders only!  \r\n\r\n*****************************************************************\r\n\r\nThanks again, and have a SUPER DAY!\r\n\r\nYOUR Flask Is OUR Task!","currency_code":"USD","is_vacation":false,"vacation_message":null,"sale_message":"Thanks again for your support!  We no longer offer custom lasering services for any of our products at this time.  We&#39;ve had to many costly technical issues related to our laser machine in recent weeks, so decided to halt this service, at least for now.  We may bring that service back again in the future.\r\n\r\nFor now, though, we&#39;ve reduced the prices of all of our flask products, to accommodate the lack of lasering services at this time.  However, we make a helpful suggestion in all of our listings regarding where else you can take your color flasks to have them custom laser etched.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIf you&#39;re in a hurry, please request either an upgrade in our shipping services (costs vary based on order size, weight and destination), or our famous RUSH Service ($2.00 per flask-funnel Set).\r\n\r\nAlso, in-country orders of 2 or more flask-funnel sets automatically receive a FREE Priority Mail shipping upgrade. \r\n\r\nThanks again, take care, and enjoy your new toy(s)!","digital_sale_message":null,"last_updated_tsz":1457553808,"listing_active_count":300,"digital_listing_count":0,"login_name":"FlasksPlus","accepts_custom_requests":true,"policy_welcome":"Welcome to our shop here on Etsy! We are VERY disgruntled (upset) former EBay Power Sellers, who grew EXTREMELY weery of their escalating auction pricing structure and rules.  THEIR rising auction fees caused US to raise the prices on what we sold, which thus financially squeezed our customers excessively!  I am a full time Marketing Education teacher at a local high school, and my wife supports what I do with my spare time business.\r\n\r\nDue to EBay&#39;s growing GREED explained above, my wife and I have broken away from EBay for the most part, and have started up two separate web sites, as well as this shop here on Etsy.  Eventually, all 3 locations will be fully stocked with our regular merchandise, as well as that which we wish to clear out of our inventory.  In the meantime, feel free to shop any or all three locations, and purchase or inquire about what you would like.  We can help arrange safe and secure payments for it all.  \r\n\r\nWhat will eventually become our BASE web site is:\r\nwww.FlasksPlus.com.  At the present time, we don&#39;t have the PayPal shopping carts in place, but they should be there shortly.  We&#39;re also adding more merchandise as we find the time to do so.  \r\n\r\nOur secondary web site is one where we&#39;re using a LIVE chat room as a draw to it.  We don&#39;t have a more personalized domain name (web address) for it yet, but we&#39;ll relay it to all of our customers as soon as we DO.  For now, here is the link that will take you there:\r\nhttp:\/\/robertorrjr.tripod.com\/freechat\/\r\nWe have a growing list of nice gift ideas posted on THAT site, all of which can be used for special ocasions, such as wedding party gifts, graduations, birthdays, holidays, and more.  Most of the merchandise showing on that site location can be customized, either through embroidery, laser engraving, etc.\r\n\r\nAs is the case with all three of our locations, feel free to email us directly, when you have any questions, comments or concerns!  We are here to help you get what you need!  You may email us directly at:  RobOrrJr2@aol.com","policy_payment":"We tend to be VERY flexible, in terms of our payment policies. We accept PayPal, money order, personal check, and well-concealed cash payments, listed in the order of the most secure options.  \r\n\r\nPayPal is the most secure form of payment, and we can either accept your detailed payment invoices sent by you through YOUR PayPal account to our email address (RobOrrJr2@aol.com), or WE can create and send a secure itemized invoice through OUR account to your email address.  Either way works fine.  Using PayPal allows us to ship your goods immediately with our next USPS package pickup, unless there is custom work being requested.   \r\n\r\nIf PayPal is used, please be sure to use your &quot;Confirmed&quot; mailing address on file with PayPal as your shipping address when you submit your payment.  If your address comes through marked as, &quot;Unconfirmed,&quot; then we will not be able to ship your goods. PayPal&#39;s seller protection policy forbids us from shipping to addresses that PayPal does NOT already have on file with our shoppers.  Contact us for more information.\r\n\r\nSending money orders is almost as secure as doing so through PayPal. Since money orders is like cash, we can ship your goods as quickly as we do for those who use PayPal.\r\n\r\nSending personal checks is fine as well.  However, please realize that we DO hold onto personal checks deposited in OUR bank account for up to 7 business days, to ensure the clearance of your funds, before we can ship your purchase(s).\r\n\r\nSending well-concealed cash is also fine, but not recommended.  Every now and then we sell smaller items where customers prefer to slip smaller amounts of money in envelopes, and not worry about writing checks, paying for money orders, etc.  IF you do this, please make sure that this cash is VERY well wrapped up inside your envelope, and not visible outside of it.  Also, know that we are NOT responsible for such payments being lost, stolen, etc. in transit.","policy_shipping":"For more than 95% of what we ship, we utilize the United States Postal Service (USPS).  The two primary options people have for in-country packages are &quot;Parcel Post&quot; and &quot;Priority Mail.&quot;  Parcel Post is cheaper, but takes longer than Priority Mail in most cases.  Priority Mail comes with a 2-3 days in-transit guarantee from USPS, meaning your packages should arrive in within 1-3 days from the day we ship them.\r\n\r\nOUR shipping routine tends to be on a rotating every-2-days basis.  When our next shipping day falls on a weekend or holiday, we still get our packages shipped, but we do so through a new automated postal center, located within one of our local USPS depots.  These are self-serving machines that allow us to ENSURE that our packages are always shipped on our every 2 days rotation for you.\r\n\r\nFeel free to email us about our next shipping date, before you purchase anything (RobOrrJr2@aol.com).","policy_refunds":"Under some circumstances, we&#39;ll allow for a full and unconditional refund of your items.  In other cases, we&#39;ll offer exchanges, and reimbursements for return shipping costs.  Further, in still more situations, we will offer partial refunds as well.\r\n\r\nFull and Unconditional refunds will be offered in situations where (A) we&#39;ve either sent the wrong merchandise altogether, and\/or (B) when we&#39;ve shipped something that ended up having factory related damages or defects.  We will work out THOSE details with customers on a 1-on-1 basis, as those cases arise.  In most instances where a full refund is sought, we&#39;ll simply ask you to tape up your packages neatly, include a brief now explaining the issue, circle our mailing address, mark it clearly as, &quot;Return To Sender&quot; and drop it in any USPS mail bin.   \r\n\r\nExchanges can happen for a wide variety of reasons, where the customer(s) involved wish to have the merchandise they ordered, but simply want it traded out, etc.  In cases where it&#39;s due to factory defects or damages, we&#39;ll also reimburse customers for their shipping costs to return the originally sent items. Customers in THIS situation MUST contact us prior to returning such items, so that they can receive proper return shipping instructions.\r\n\r\nFinally, in cases where customers simply change their minds about something, we are willing to take the goods back, but will issue a partial refund upon the return of the items involved, and once we inspect them for new condition, etc.  We will deduct the actual shipping costs we paid to send the item(s) to you originally, and issue your refund of the balance.  We simply cannot afford to pay 2-way shipping costs for something we shipped as pictured, described, and promised, when people change their minds.  A good way to think about this is to ask yourself if a company such as Wal Mart pays its refunding customers the gas money it took to drive to the store and back.","policy_additional":"Approximately 99% of the merchandise we sell through Etsy, and our two new and developing off-EBay web sites is BRAND new, and normally come with their original tags, boxes, and even UPC labels.

Perfect shirt to wear to that St. Patrick&#39;s Day party or parade event.\n\nAbout Your New T Shirt\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nI use new Gildan G200 or G500 100% cotton t shirts. (Except Neon Pink which is 50\/50 and Sport Grey which is 90\/10). They are pre-shrunk but you can allow 5% shrinkage for the dryer. They are very true to size. I use a premium vinyl material for the design. It will never crack, peel or fade like you get with screen printing and iron on transfers. Your design will last a long time and you do not have to wash it any special way.\n\nFAQ\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n* I ship orders every day that the Post Office is open. I ship via USPS.\n\n* I stock a pretty good selection of t shirts and onesies, so I can usually get your order out the same or next day.\n\n* The sizing chart is in the pictures. The measurements are the height and width of a t shirt that is laying flat on a surface. (you can measure one of yours to get an idea if you are unsure)\n\n* Sport Grey and White shirts come with a black lettering design. All others come in white lettering or as shown in pictures listed above.\n\n* I can do exchanges. If you accidently order the wrong size then simply send me the old one back   and I will send you out the size you need. (unfortunately you will have to pay the shipping though.)\n\nPlease visit my shop at https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/shop\/youngandstyling for more designs.\n\nThanks for visiting!","creation_tsz":1457553566,"ending_tsz":1468090766,"original_creation_tsz":1452188632,"last_modified_tsz":1457553566,"price":"14.99","currency_code":"USD","quantity":97,"tags":["t shirt","youngandstyling","funny","funny t shirt","drinking","beer","funny beer t shirt","St Patricks Day","paddy's day","hell yeah","keltic","shoot whiskey","whiskey shirt"],"category_path":["Clothing","Shirt"],"category_path_ids":[69150353,68889876],"materials":["cotton","100 percent cotton","vinyl","tshirt","t shirt","tee"],"shop_section_id":16455334,"featured_rank":null,"state_tsz":1452188632,"url":"https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/listing\/262905421\/hell-yeah-i-can-shoot-whiskey-im-irish?utm_source=theironyardteaching&utm_medium=api&utm_campaign=api","views":38,"num_favorers":6,"shipping_template_id":null,"processing_min":1,"processing_max":2,"who_made":"i_did","is_supply":"false","when_made":"made_to_order","item_weight":null,"item_weight_units":null,"item_length":null,"item_width":null,"item_height":null,"item_dimensions_unit":"in","is_private":false,"recipient":"unisex_adults","occasion":"st_patricks_day","style":null,"non_taxable":false,"is_customizable":true,"is_digital":false,"file_data":"","language":"en-US","has_variations":true,"taxonomy_id":482,"taxonomy_path":["Clothing","Unisex Adult Clothing","Tops & Tees","T-shirts"],"used_manufacturer":false,"Images":[{"listing_image_id":899387212,"hex_code":"EB8C73","red":235,"green":140,"blue":115,"hue":12,"saturation":51,"brightness":92,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1452188633,"listing_id":262905421,"rank":1,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/107\/1\/10140513\/il_75x75.899387212_rcgd.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/107\/1\/10140513\/il_170x135.899387212_rcgd.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/107\/1\/10140513\/il_570xN.899387212_rcgd.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/107\/1\/10140513\/il_fullxfull.899387212_rcgd.jpg","full_height":706,"full_width":788},{"listing_image_id":899387172,"hex_code":"7BBC96","red":123,"green":188,"blue":150,"hue":145,"saturation":34,"brightness":73,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1452188633,"listing_id":262905421,"rank":2,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/127\/0\/10140513\/il_75x75.899387172_q8za.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/127\/0\/10140513\/il_170x135.899387172_q8za.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/127\/0\/10140513\/il_570xN.899387172_q8za.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/127\/0\/10140513\/il_fullxfull.899387172_q8za.jpg","full_height":703,"full_width":785},{"listing_image_id":689123124,"hex_code":"B4A8B1","red":180,"green":168,"blue":177,"hue":315,"saturation":6,"brightness":70,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1452188633,"listing_id":262905421,"rank":3,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/055\/0\/10140513\/il_75x75.689123124_ir3c.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/055\/0\/10140513\/il_170x135.689123124_ir3c.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/055\/0\/10140513\/il_570xN.689123124_ir3c.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/055\/0\/10140513\/il_fullxfull.689123124_ir3c.jpg","full_height":632,"full_width":596}],"Shop":{"shop_id":10140513,"shop_name":"youngandstyling","user_id":54752348,"creation_tsz":1413652269,"title":"Unique and Custom Children&#39;s Clothing","announcement":"YoungandStyling offers unique one of a kind custom clothing.
